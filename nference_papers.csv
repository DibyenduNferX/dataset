COVID-associated pediatric hospitalization and ICU admission trends across a multi-state health system and the broader US population,"AbstractPublic health concerns are emerging based on reports of new SARS-CoV-2 variant strains purportedly triggering a rise in COVID-associated hospitalizations and ICU admissions, particularly in younger patients and the pediatric population. However, analyzing health records of COVID patients from the electronic health records (EHRs) of a multi-state US healthcare system, we find that there is actually a significant drop in COVID-associated hospitalization rates and ICU admission rates in March 2021 compared to February 2021. We further triangulate these EHR-derived insights with the official US government epidemiological data sets to show that  during  this same time  period,  there  is  no  apparent  nation-wide  spike  in pediatric hospitalizations. Our study motivates the need to develop a real-time system that integrates various COVID hospitalization and ICU monitoring efforts from  the  EHR databases  of  various  health  systems  together  with  national epidemiological data sets. By infusing SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing data to flag  potentially  new  or  emergent viral strains,  as  well  as  county-level COVID vaccine rollout rates and shifts in SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rates into such a real-time monitoring system, public health policies and media reporting can be more effectively informed through the rigor of holistic biomedical data sciences.IntroductionMedia reports this week are suggesting a potential spike up in COVID-19 genetic variants-associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for younger patients from the continents of North America1–3, South America4,5, and Europe6,7.  Here, we conducted an observational study on the health records of 60,539 patients (March 1-28, 2021) and 60,256 patients (February 1-28, 2021) from the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system for whom the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results were also available. We then juxtaposed these results on to the national epidemiological data from the US government as of March 29, 2021 (https://healthdata.gov/).8 .

2MethodsStudy design This  is  a  retrospective  study  of  individuals  who  underwent  polymerase  chain reaction  (PCR)  testing  for  suspected  SARS-CoV-2  infection  at  the  Mayo  Clinic  and hospitals affiliated with the Mayo Clinic Health System. This study was reviewed by the Mayo  Clinic  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  and  determined  to  be  exempt  from  the requirement for IRB approval (45 CFR 46.104d, category 4). Subjects were excluded if they did not have a research authorization on file.ResultsAnalysis ofthe health records fromMayo Clinic health system for patients wherethe SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results were also availableas of March 29, 2021showsa significant drop in the ICU admission rates during March (1.45%; 87 of 6017 COVIDpospatients) compared to February (1.99%; 121 of 6078 COVIDpospatients) with a Rate Ratio of 0.78 (p-value = 0.0002; Figure 1a). In this study population, there is a slight shift in the peak of ICU admissions towards the younger population in March relative to February (Figure 1b). While this trend is not statisticallysignificant at this time, this particular shift requires further monitoring over the coming weeks.Restricting  the  study  population  to  younger  COVIDpospatients  (age  <  55),  we observe a drop in the number of ICU admissions in March compared to February (not statistically significant; Figure 2a).Consistent with the drop in the ICU admission rate, we also see a statistically significant drop in the hospitalization rate in March 2021 (10.97%; 660  of  6017  COVIDpospatients)  compared  to  February  2021  (13.64%;  829  of  6078 COVIDpospatients) with a rate ratio of 0.8 (p-value: 2.34e-12; Figure 2b). Focusing the study population to the younger COVIDpospatients (age < 55), we observe a drop in the number of hospitalizations in March compared to February (notstatistically significant; Figure 2c). Independently,    the    national    data    fromthe    US    government (https://healthdata.gov/)8also shows a steady drop over recent months in hospitalized pediatric patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (Figure 3a). We observe similar trends in the top-10 states by population as well (Figure 3b).DiscussionThis preliminary analysis shows that there is a decreasing trend in ICU admissions and hospitalization of COVID-19 patients across a large multi-state health system as of March  2021.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  apparent  nation-wide  spike  in  pediatric hospitalizations in March compared to February 2021.Decreased hospitalizations and  .

Higher COVID-19 vaccination rates are linked to decreased county-level COVID-19 incidence across USA,"Real  world  evidence  studies  of  mass  vaccination  across  health  systems  have reaffirmed the safety1and efficacy2,3of the FDA-authorized mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. However,   the   impact   of   vaccination   on   community   transmission   remains   to   be characterized.  Here,  we  compare  the  cumulative  county-level  vaccination  rates  with  the corresponding COVID-19 incidence rates among 87 million individuals from 580 counties in  the  United  States,  including  12  million  individuals  who  have  received  at  least  one vaccine dose. We find that cumulative county-level vaccination rate through March 1, 2021 is significantly associated with a concomitant decline in COVID-19 incidence (Spearman correlation⍴= -0.22,  p-value  =  8.3e-8),  withstronger  negative  correlations  in  the Midwestern counties (⍴= -0.37, p-value = 1.3e-7) and Southern counties (⍴= -0.33, p-value = 4.5e-5) studied. Additionally, all examined US regions demonstrate significant negative correlations between cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate prior to the vaccine rollout and the decline in the COVID-19 incidence rate between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, with  the  US  western  region  being  particularly  striking  (⍴= -0.66,  p-value  =  5.3e-37). However, the cumulative vaccination rate and cumulative incidence rate are noted to be statistically  independent  variables,  emphasizing  the  need  to  continue  the  ongoing vaccination roll out at scale. Given confounders such as different coronavirus restrictions and mask mandates, varying population densities, and distinct levels of diagnostic testing and vaccine availabilities across US counties, we are advancing a public health resource to  amplify  transparency  in  vaccine  efficacy  monitoring  (https://public.nferx.com/covid-monitor-lab/vaccinationcheck). Application of this resource highlights outliers like Dimmit county  (Texas),  where  infection  rates  have  increased  significantly  despite  higher vaccination rates, ostensibly owing to amplified travel as a “vaccination hub”; as well as Henry county (Ohio) which encountered shipping delays leading to postponement of the vaccine  clinics.  This  study  underscores  the  importance  of  tying  the  ongoing  vaccine rollout to a real-time monitor of spatio-temporal vaccine efficacy to help turn the tide of the COVID-19 pandemic.As mass vaccination efforts ramp up worldwide to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need for real-time assessment of how factors such as vaccination rates impact SARS-CoV-2 community transmission and localized outbreaks. As of March 2, 2021, over 51 million individuals in the United States have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, including over 26 million  .

2individuals who have been fully vaccinated with both doses of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines4. While these mRNA vaccines were shown to decrease the  risk  for  symptomatic  COVID-19  in  Phase  3  clinical  trials5,6,  we  and  others  have  recently reaffirmed their real world efficacy and safety via holistic inference from context-rich electronic health records (EHRs) across American and Israeli health systems2,7.In  order  to  conduct  a  real-world  analysis  of  the  impact  of  vaccination  on  COVID-19 incidence in the USA, we first obtained county-level PCR testing data from the CDC COVID Data Tracker4. We also obtained temporal and cumulative county-level vaccination data (number of patients who have received at least 1 vaccine dose) from CovidActNow8as of March 1, 2021. The CovidActNowdataset includes vaccine administration data from 580 counties from the District of Columbia and 13 US states including: Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Wyoming, with a total population of over 87 million. This includes over 12 million individuals who have received at least one dose of either the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.Contrasting the 7-day PCR positivity rates in the week leading up to March 1,2021 (current vaccination phase) vs. the week leading up to December 1,2020 (pre-vaccination phase), we observe  a  sharp  decline  in  COVID-19  incidence  across  the  country  (Figure  1A).  Numerous factors  that  are  unrelated  to  the  vaccine  rollout  may  have  contributed  to  this  decline,  hence necessitating quantification of vaccination impact on this trend. In order to assess the impact of the  vaccination  on  localized  COVID-19  incidence,  we  examined  the  correlation  between  two metrics: (i) Cumulative county-level vaccination rate: percentage of the county population who have received at least one dose, and (ii) December-March change in COVID-19 incidence rate: Difference in 7-day COVID-19 incidence rates from December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021.  The 7-day COVID-19 incidence rate is the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the county per 10,000 individuals averaged over the past 7 days. We find that the cumulative county-level vaccination rate  is  significantly  negatively  correlated  with  the  December-March  change  in  COVID-19 incidence rate (Figure 1B;Spearman’s ⍴= -0.22, p-value: 8.3e-08; SupplementaryFigure S1 -with 95% confidence intervals added to the y-axis). We also independently performed a manual curation of cumulative vaccination rates through March 1, 2021 across 1408 counties from 28 states, and the negative correlation with the December-March change in COVID-19 incidence rate was consistent (Supplementary Figure S2). This shows that higher COVID-19 vaccination rates are associated with decreased county-level COVID-19 incidence for these counties in the United States. To evaluate the impact of vaccination in different parts of the country, we grouped the counties into four regions9: (i) Midwest: Ohio, Minnesota, Missouri; (ii) South: District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland;(iii) West: Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming; and (iv) Northeast:Maine, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania. Interestingly, there is a significant negative correlation between  the  cumulative  vaccination  rate  and  the  December-March  change  in  COVID-19 incidence rate for the Midwest (Figure 2A;⍴=-0.37, p-value: 1.3e-7) and the South (Figure 2B;⍴=-0.33, p-value: 4.5e-5). The counties in the West (Figure  2C;⍴=-0.06, p-value: 0.61) and Northeast  (Figure  2D; ⍴=0.19, p-value:  0.2)  regions  do  not  demonstrate any  substantial correlation.  .

3Given that the above analysis does not factor in pre-existing immunity from prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and particularly since certain parts of the country experienced more severe outbreaks during earlier phases of the pandemic (e.g.,New York, Seattle), we next looked at the relationship between cumulative county-level incidence rate up to December 1, 2020 and the change in COVID-19 incidence rates (December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021). While we find that there  is  a  significant  negative  correlation  in  the  counties  across  all  the  four  regions,  the  US western region counties are particularly distinctive in their significance(Figure 3A-E). Although cumulative COVID-19 incidence through prior infection waves appears to be associated with the ongoing decline of county-level COVID-19 incidence, it must be noted that this phenomenonis independent of the cumulative vaccination rate (SupplementaryFigure S3). While differential levels of prior COVID infectivity levels and ongoing vaccine rollout may consequently both factor into  the  distinct  county-level  trends  in  SARS-CoV-2  positivity,  their  statistical  independence emphasizes the need to continue mass vaccination at scale.In an attempt to account for the time taken for effect of vaccination on the decline in the prevailing county level incidence rates (as of March 1, 2021), we next allowed a one-month “gap period”, analyzing the effect of cumulative COVID-19 vaccination until only February 1, 2021.This temporal recordof COVID-19 vaccination as of February 1, 2021 is available at the county level from Texas, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, and District of Columbia. Analysis of this data shows that the cumulative county-level vaccination rate until February 1, 2021 is significantly negatively correlated with the December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021 change in COVID-19 incidence rate (SupplementaryFigure  S4;⍴=-0.27, p-value=3.5e-8). This preliminary analysis at the early phases of vaccine rollout incorporating a time-delayfor vaccine-induced immunity to manifest does  underline  the  positive  impact  of  vaccine  administration  on  the  decline  of  COVID-19 incidence. The 1-month “gap period” used for this analysis is purely exemplary andmay require adjusting for various factors such as distinct mechanisms of the 2-dose mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech versus, for example, the recently FDA-authorized 1-dose vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J)10.We note that there are a number of extrinsic factors that could confound the associations observed in this study. For example, county-level policies on social distancing norms and their enforcement could impact COVID-19 incidence11. Rates of PCR-testing and case reporting are important confounders as well, which are analyzed through a preliminary analysis of the available percent positivity rates (PPR) at the county-level (Supplementary Figure S5). The COVID-19 cases that were asymptomatic and undiagnosed clinically cannot be accounted for in this study. There is variation in terms of demographic factors (e.g.,age above 65) and population density between  counties.  Socio-economic  differences  between  counties  such  as  level  of  access  to healthcare and insurance could also affect the findings presented here. In addition, study design choices such as the time period for the analysis (December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2020) could impact the findings as well.  To address this issue,we conducted a sensitivity analysis varying the start date for the study period, includingNovember 15, 2020, December 1, 2020 (actual study start date selected), December 15, 2020, January 1, 2021, January 15, 2021 (Supplementary Figure S6).  We observethat the correlation between cumulative vaccination rate and change in 7-day COVID-19 incidence changes for each of the four regions as the study start date varies, which may be explained by different vaccine rollout times in these regions.

4into account particular vaccine rollout dates for different counties could help us better understand these distinct spatio-temporal trends.  Given the evolving situation with COVID-19 incidence and vaccination rates, there is an imminent need to monitor the real-time impact at a county level in order to guide public health measures and policy decisions. Towards this, we are advancing a public health resource for amplifying  transparency  in  vaccine  efficacy  monitoring  tied  to  spatio-temporal  news  feeds (https://public.nferx.com/covid-monitor-lab/vaccinationcheck). Applying this resource to analyze outliers in our vaccine efficacy analysis highlights examples such as Dimmit County in Texas (Figure 4A) and Henry County in Ohio (Figure 4B). In Dimmit County, there was a surprising increase in COVID-19 incidence between December-March while a majority of the other Texas counties underwent significant decreases in incidence, despite Dimmit being one of the counties with highest vaccination rates in Texas. The associatednews feed on our app1suggests that, by virtue of being a “vaccine hub”, extensive out-of-county travel was associated with this county during the CDC-mandated Phase-1a vaccination period (Figure  4A). Another interesting case study from use of our resource to study outliers is Henry County in Ohio, that displays a significant increase in COVID-positivity from pre-vaccination (December 1, 2020) to current time (March 1, 2021), despite its neighboring counties significantly improving their COVID-positivity during that time period. The associated news feedon the app2suggests that the COVID vaccine clinics in Henry county were postponed owing to shipment delays, which may explain in part the disturbing trend vis-a-vis the prevailing COVID incidence in this county (Figure 4B). Finally, an exemplar of a highly vaccinated neighborhood is Churchill County in Nevada (Figure 4C), which displays a concomitant decrease in COVID incidence during the Phase 1a vaccination period3.Even as people await their turn to get vaccinated, there are reports of subpopulationsdeclining to get vaccinated owing misinformation around the vaccines’ safety and efficacy, which is being amplified through social media12. On the heels of the real-world based evidence on the vaccine’s safety1and the efficacy2,3for the vaccinated individuals, this study and the associated resource we have built emphasizes the positive public health impact of the vaccination campaign and further  motivates  the  rapid  vaccine  rollout  globally  to  quell  the  COVID-19  pandemic comprehensively. ",NA,"Real world evidence studies of mass vaccination across health systems have reaffirmed the safety1 and efficacy2,3 of the FDA-authorized mRNA vaccines for COVID-19. However, the impact of vaccination on community transmission remains to be characterized. Here, we compare the cumulative county-level vaccination rates with the corresponding COVID-19 incidence rates among 87 million individuals from 580 counties in the United States, including 12 million individuals who have received at least one vaccine dose. We find that cumulative county-level vaccination rate through March 1, 2021 is significantly associated with a concomitant decline in COVID-19 incidence (Spearman correlation ρ = −0.22, p-value = 8.3e-8), with stronger negative correlations in the Midwestern counties (ρ = −0.37, p-value = 1.3e-7) and Southern counties (ρ = −0.33, p-value = 4.5e-5) studied. Additionally, all examined US regions demonstrate significant negative correlations between cumulative COVID-19 incidence rate prior to the vaccine rollout and the decline in the COVID-19 incidence rate between December 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021, with the US western region being particularly striking (ρ = −0.66, p-value = 5.3e-37). However, the cumulative vaccination rate and cumulative incidence rate are noted to be statistically independent variables, emphasizing the need to continue the ongoing vaccination roll out at scale.

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is not significantly linked to COVID-19 vaccines or non-COVID vaccines in a large multi-state US health system,"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has been reported in a small number of individuals who have received the mRNA vaccines1or the adenoviral  vector vaccines for COVID-19 in the US2and Europe3. Continued pharmacovigilance is integral to mitigating the  risk  of  rare  adverse  events  that  clinical  trials  are  underpowered  to  detect, however, these  anecdotal  reports  have  led  to  the  pause  or  withdrawal  of  some  vaccines  in  many jurisdictions and exacerbated vaccine hesitancy at a critical moment in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the frequencies of CVST seen among individuals who received FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 94,818 doses), Moderna (n = 36,350 doses) and Johnson & Johnson -J&J (n = 1,745 doses), and among individuals receiving one of 10 FDA-approved non-COVID-19 vaccines (n =771,805 doses). Comparing  the  incidence  rates  of  CVST  in  30-day  time  windows  before  and  after vaccination, we found no statistically significant differences for the COVID-19 vaccines or any other vaccines studied in this population. In total, we observed 3 cases of CVST within the 30 days following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination (2 females, 1 male; Ages (years): [79, 80, 84]), including one individual with a prior history of thrombosis and another individual with recent trauma in the past 30 days. We did not observe any cases of CVST among the patients receiving Moderna or J&J vaccines in this study population. We further found the baseline CVST incidence in the study population between 2017 and 2021 to be45 to 98 per million patient years. Overall, this real-world evidence-based study highlights that CVST is rare and is not significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, there is a  need  for  a  concerted  international  effort  to  monitor  EHR  data  across  diverse  patient populations and to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms leading to these rare clotting events. IntroductionAs of April 12, 2021 more than 96 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, 83 million doses of the Moderna mRNA vaccine, and 6 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) adenovirus vectored vaccine have been administered in the United States4. In six patients who received the J&J vaccine (reporting rate 0.87 per million) there have been reportsof the  development  of  a  rare  and  dangerous  adverse  event,  cerebral  venous  sinus  thrombosis  .

2(CVST) associated with thrombocytopenia, in the weeks following vaccine administration5,6. All six casesoccurred among women between the ages of 18 and 48, a high-risk group for this condition7, and symptoms occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination8. One healthy 25-year old male who received the J&J vaccine as a part of the clinical trial also developed CVST9. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is investigating an association between the AstraZeneca adenoviral vectored COVID-19 vaccine and the development of a similar thrombotic phenotype. An EMA committee carried out an in-depth review of 62 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and 24 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis reported in the EU drug safety database (EudraVigilance) as of 22 March 2021. The cases were primarily generated via the spontaneous reporting systems of the EMA and the UK where around 25 million people have received the vaccine10. Although there is no consensus regarding the causality of these associations or their appropriate  impact  on  vaccine  use11,  this  phenotype  has  now  been  dubbed  vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)12. This name derives from the similar laboratory and clinical findings in patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), including widespread thrombosis  in  the context  of  declining  platelets  and  elevated  anti-platelet  factor  4  (PF4) antibodies).  Importantly,  most  individuals  in  whom  CVST  and  thrombocytopenia  have  been reported after COVID-19 vaccination were not previously exposed to heparin, indicating that thisrepresents a process which is pathophysiologically distinct from HIT. Of note, concerns surrounding CVST and VITT primarily involve two adenovirus vectored vaccines and worries about a potential class effect. So far similar concerns have not been raised with regard to the two mRNA vaccines authorized for use in the United States (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna). However, there are reports of CVST occurring in individuals after receiving the mRNA vaccines12,and one group found a 4 in 1 million risk of developing CVST following receipt of an mRNA vaccine in their study cohort13. The accumulation of case reports has led to pauses and use restriction of adenoviral vectored vaccines in the United States and Europe, which could have major implications for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of this, it is critical to understand whether the risk of developing CVST is actually higher after receiving aCOVID-19 vaccine than before, and specifically whether any COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA or adenoviral) demonstrably increase the risk of developing CVST and/or VITT. This study investigates these questions by leveraging a large multi-state EHR system to analyze individuals who have received over 130,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines and over 771,000 doses of non-COVID-19 vaccines.MethodsInstitutional Review Board (IRB)This is a retrospective study of individuals who underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Mayo Clinic and hospitals affiliated with the Mayo Clinic Health System.

3Study design, setting and populationThis is a retrospective study of individuals who were vaccinated in the Mayo Clinic hospital system between January 1, 2017 and March 15, 2021 and also received at least one SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The outcome of interest was cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, identified either by the presence of a corresponding ICD code (I67.6, I63.6, O22.5, G08.X) or by an NLP algorithm that detected a positive diagnosis of CVST of synonyms concepts in their clinical notes (eMethods in  Supplement).  Clinicians  manually  reviewed  the  patients  identified  as  positive  for  CVST  to confirm that it was an acute diagnosis. Subjects were excluded if they did not have a research authorization on file. No subjects were excluded on the basis of demographics, comorbidities, or other clinical characteristics.Incidence ratesIncidence rates of first-time CVST were calculated as the number of events observed within a given time period divided by the total number of patient-years in the observation period. For  the  calculation  of  background  incidence  rates  from  2017  to  present,  each  of  the 30-daywindows following the 771,305 vaccine administrationswere removed from the total number of patient-years of observation; any CVST events occurring within these windows were not counted towards the background incidence rate and the corresponding patients were removed from the cohort at the time of CVST occurrence. For the calculation of incidence rates within vaccine risk windows,  the  observation  period  was  defined  as  the 1–30-dayperiod  following  vaccine administration. Confidence intervals are 1.96 x standard error (SE) where SE = (N/t2)0.5; Nis the numberof CVST events and tis the observation period duration multiplied by the number of patients under observation.Statistical analysisWe described the characteristics and frequency of cases of CVST stratified by vaccine. For  each  vaccine,  we  reported  the  number  of  patients  newly  diagnosed  with  CVST  for  the following time periods: +1 to +30 days after the vaccine dose, +1 to +15 daysafter the vaccine dose, -30 to -1 days before the vaccine dose, and -15 to -1 days before the vaccine dose. We set an at-risk window for CVST post-vaccination to 30 days as all cases reported thus far in the literature and VAERS fell within this window. We defined the relative risk to be post-vaccination incidence in the (+1 to +30 days) divided by the pre-vaccination incidence (-30 to -1 days), and we reported 95% confidence intervals for this metric. In addition, we computed Fisher exact test p-values for the null hypothesis that the relative risk is equal to one. Analyses were conducted in the Python programming language. Augmented curation of unstructured clinical notesWe used artificial intelligence (AI) driven augmented curation of EHR clinical notes from  601,741 patients between January 1, 2017 and April 15, 2021 from the Mayo Clinic health system to determine CVST diagnoses and other comorbidities.The augmented curation approach has been detailed previously14. Briefly, we used previously developed and detailed state-of-the-art BERT-based neural networks to rapidly curate clinical notes that were authored within 6 months of  and  COVID-19  diagnoses.  Specifically,  the  model  extracts  sentences  containing  clinical  .

4phenotypes  and  symptoms  and  classifies  their  sentiment  into  the  following  categories:  Yes (confirmed clinical manifestation or diagnosis), No (ruled out clinical manifestation or diagnosis), Maybe (possibility of clinical manifestation or diagnosis), and Other (alternate context, e.g., family history of disease). The neural networks are pre-trained on 3.17 billion tokens from the biomedical and computer science domains (SciBERT) and subsequently trained using 18,490 sentences and approximately 250 phenotypes with an emphasis on cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic phenotypes. It achieves 93.6% overall accuracy and over 95% precision and recall for both “Yes” and “No” sentiment classification. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System reviewWe  also  looked  at  the  data  collected  by  Vaccine  Adverse  Event  Reporting  System (VAERS)15. We searched for records of any vaccine that had any of the following adverse events: (10007830) Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis, (10061251) Intracranial Venous Sinus Thrombosis, (10042567)  Superior  Sagittal  Sinus  Thrombosis,  (10008138)  Cerebral  Venous  Thrombosis, (10083037)  Cerebral  Venous  Sinus  Thrombosis,  (10044457)  Transverse  Sinus  Thrombosis within 30 days. As of April 17, 2021, VAERS has data up to April 10, 2021.ResultsWe determined the background incidence rate of CVST at the Mayo Clinic, defined as the incidence rate of CVST excluding all 30 day time windows following the administration of any non-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (266,094 unique patients, 771,805 vaccination events). In total, 165 CVST events were identified. The incidence rate ranged from 45 to 98 per million patient years between 2017 and 2021 (Figure 1A). We then investigated the occurrence of CVST in individuals receiving a COVID-19 vaccine or various non-COVID-19 vaccines. Of the 132,916 total COVID-19 vaccine doses administered, 1,745 were the Janssen vaccine, 36,352 were the Moderna and 94,819 the Pfizer/BioNTech.  771,805  non-COVID-19  vaccine  doses  were  captured  in  our  cohort.  We computed annual CVST incidence rates in the non-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine risk window (Figure 1B) and  the  incidence  rate  to-date  in  the  SARS-CoV-2  (Figure  1C)  vaccine  risk  window.  These incidence rates ranged from 0 to 125 per million patient years for non-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and 292 per million patient years for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, though the standard errors in these cases were larger than the computed incidence rates.  Among the 165 cases of CVST identified since 2017,  four  patients  also  had  thrombocytopenia  (platelets  <  150k/ul)  within  3  days  of  CVST diagnosis, for an incidence rate of 2 per million patient years. In three cases, platelets were in the 133k-146k/ul range, and in one case, platelets were in the 74k-84k/ul range. None of these cases occurred in the 30 days following a vaccination of any type. Among patients receiving any COVID-19 vaccine, there were 10 cases of CVST observed (0.0019%) in the 30 days following vaccine administration, and 10 cases of CVST were observedin  the  30  days  prior  to  administration.  3  of  the  10  post-vaccination  CVST  cases  were  from individuals receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, but there were also 3 cases among this same cohort in the 30-day pre-vaccination window, suggesting that these events were likely not caused by the vaccine (RR: 1.0, 95% CI: [0.23, 4.40] (Table 1). To date, no cases of CVST have been documented within 30 days before or after any doses of the Moderna or Janssen vaccines at the  .

5Mayo  Clinic  (Table  1).  The  relative  risk  of  CVST  in  the  30  days  following  any  COVID-19 vaccination was not statistically significant (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: [0.28, 7.10], seeTable 1). The clinical characteristics of the patients in the study population with CVST and the subset of patients with CVST following COVID-19 vaccination is provided in Table 2. In total, we observed 3 cases of CVST within the 30 days following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination (2 females, 1 male; Ages (years): [79, 80, 84]), including one individual with a prior history of thrombosis and another individual with recent trauma in the past 30 days.  The older ages of these patients and lack of concurrent thrombocytopenia further suggests that these events were distinct from the VITT phenotype which has been reported predominantly in younger females. As compared to all individuals who experienced CVST regardless of vaccination status, patients experiencing CVST after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine generally were older (81.4 +/-2.8 years old vs. 47.7 +/-22.3 years old) and had more comorbidities (2.3 +/-2.1 comorbidities vs. 1.3 +/-1.6 comorbidities). Discussion Vaccines to prevent COVID-19 were developed and tested atan unprecedented pace over the past year. They have shown excellent effectiveness both in randomized clinical trials and in the real world setting 16–18. While no major safety concerns were identified during the large Phase 3 trials of each authorized vaccine, it is important that their safety is continually assessed throughout the vaccine rollout process. Recent case reports of individuals experiencing CVST with  thrombocytopenia shortly  after  receiving  an  adenoviral  vector  COVID-19  vaccine  and increased reporting of CVST in VAERS following COVID-19 vaccination as compared to historical rates  (Supplementary  Table  1)  have  raised  safety  concerns,  leading  to  the  temporary suspension of some COVID-19 vaccines awaiting causality investigations. While it is important to consider this reporting in pharmacovigilance decision-making, there is reason to interpret such reports with caution. Spontaneous adverse event reporting is prone to reporting bias and increased event reporting with lay press attention or the introduction of a novel agent20–22.During this time it is critical to rapidly extract and analyze the content of EHR systems throughout the United States in order to validate or refute whether the risk for this phenotype is in fact  increased  by  one  or  more  authorized  vaccines.  In  this  retrospective  study  of  vaccine recipients  across  a  large  multi-state  healthcare  system, we  did  not  detect  any  significant association between COVID-19 vaccination status and the development of CVST. Specifically, we found that (1) the risk of CVST was similar in the 30 days prior to COVID-19 vaccination compared to the 30 days after vaccination; (2) therisk of CVST within 30 days of COVID-19 vaccination was similar to the risk of CVST within 30 days of all analyzed non-COVID vaccinations; and (3) the risk of CVST after COVID-19 vaccination was similar to the baseline risk of CVST across a large cohort of patients in a multi-state healthcare system. Our  analysis  demonstrates  that  to  date  no  vaccine  of  any  class,  for  COVID-19  or otherwise, has been associated with a statistically significant increased relative risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in the Mayo Clinic Health System. If the average CVST incidence rate seen in our cohort (71.7 per million patient years) was extrapolated across the United States we would expect to see approximately 19 cases of CVST in the 14 days after vaccination amongst  .

6the 7 million patients who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by chance alone, while there has been only 6 reported cases to date. This is in line with earlier research demonstrating that the incidence rate of venous thromboembolism was no higher than expected following viral vector vaccine administration23and was similar across COVID-19 vaccines13. Of note, our cohort incidencerate was several times that reported in other American cohorts24. This is likely due to our data originating from tertiary care hospitals and our ability to find CVST diagnoses in free-text as well asrecorded ICD-10 codes. Further real-world evidence studies are needed to confirm these findings, but pharmacovigilance regulators should consider such evidence when making decisions regarding the critically important vaccine roll out.This study has several limitations. First, we analyzed data from a single healthsystem which is demographically distinct from the broader United States population. In addition, the study population was restricted to individuals who have received at least one PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at the Mayo Clinic, which is different from the overall vaccinated population. Second, as a retrospective  study  our  analyses  are  inherently  limited  to  only  the  data  which  was  deemed necessary for collection during the clinical care of each patient.For example, platelet counts are not available for most individuals within 30 days of any vaccination and quantification of anti-PF4 antibodies are even more sparse. Other clinical covariates not included in the analysis such as oral contraceptives and smoking status may be potential confounding factors. Finally, our cohort contains 1,745 individuals who received the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine. Given that VITT has only been reported in 6 of approximately 7 million recipients of this vaccine2,we are unlikely to detect a signal for it in this cohort. Despite these limitations, the estimation of the baseline incidence rate for CVST, as well as  for  CVST  with  thrombocytopenia,  in  a  cohort  of  over  600,000  individuals  is  useful  to contextualize thereported frequencies of CVST and VITT in patients receiving all authorized COVID-19 vaccines. It also highlights the fact that CVST is likely an under-reported entity in the VAERS  database,  and  that  clinicians  should  be  vigilant  for  and  report  this  event after  any vaccination in order to facilitate further research into the nature of vaccine associated thrombosis.","Vaccines to prevent COVID-19 were developed and tested atan unprecedented pace over the past year.

It also highlights the fact that CVST is likely an under-reported entity in the VAERS  database,  and  that  clinicians  should  be  vigilant  for  and  report  this  event after  any vaccination in order to facilitate further research into the nature of vaccine associated thrombosis.","Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has been reported in a small number of individuals who have received the mRNA vaccines1or the adenoviral  vector vaccines for COVID-19 in the US2and Europe3. Continued pharmacovigilance is integral to mitigating the  risk  of  rare  adverse  events  that  clinical  trials  are  underpowered  to  detect, however, these  anecdotal  reports  have  led  to  the  pause  or  withdrawal  of  some  vaccines  in  many jurisdictions and exacerbated vaccine hesitancy at a critical moment in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the frequencies of CVST seen among individuals who received FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 94,818 doses), Moderna (n = 36,350 doses) and Johnson & Johnson -J&J (n = 1,745 doses), and among individuals receiving one of 10 FDA-approved non-COVID-19 vaccines (n =771,805 doses). Comparing  the  incidence  rates  of  CVST  in  30-day  time  windows  before  and  after vaccination, we found no statistically significant differences for the COVID-19 vaccines or any other vaccines studied in this population. In total, we observed 3 cases of CVST within the 30 days following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination (2 females, 1 male; Ages (years): [79, 80, 84]), including one individual with a prior history of thrombosis and another individual with recent trauma in the past 30 days. We did not observe any cases of CVST among the patients receiving Moderna or J&J vaccines in this study population. We further found the baseline CVST incidence in the study population between 2017 and 2021 to be45 to 98 per million patient years. Overall, this real-world evidence-based study highlights that CVST is rare and is not significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, there is a  need  for  a  concerted  international  effort  to  monitor  EHR  data  across  diverse  patient populations and to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms leading to these rare clotting events."
Antigenic minimalism of SARS-CoV-2 is linked to surges in COVID-19 community transmission and vaccine breakthrough infections,"3from electronic health records, we also identify deletion mutations in SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19  patients  with  infection/vaccine-breakthrough  infections,  also  mapping  near  the  antibody-binding site and thus representing candidates for vaccine escape mutations.  ResultsDeletions are enriched for association with surges in community transmission of SARS-CoV-2Analysis  of1,567,718  SARS-CoV-2  genome  sequences  obtained  from  the  GISAID database17(Figure 1a) revealed the presence of 857 amino acid mutations (missense, insertions and deletions) in the Spike protein. This list included mutations that were observed in at least 100 SARS-CoV-2  genome  sequences  in  order  to  exclude  random  occurrences  from  sequencing errors. The list of 857 mutations included 816 substitutions (95.2%), 37 deletions (4.3%), and 4 insertions (0.4%).To identify the mutations associated with surges in the community transmission of   COVID-19  (“surge-associated   mutations''),   we   shortlisted   mutations   that   increased   in prevalence monotonically during periods of monotonically increasing test positivity (Figure 1b). We  identified  89  mutations  that  increased  in  prevalence  during  one  or  more  surges  in  test positivity  rate  (with  minimum  change  in  test  positivity  rate  >=  5%  and  minimum  change  in mutational prevalence >=5% over the three-month window), in any country, over a three-month time interval. This approach recapitulated 39 out of 56 (70%) mutations known to be present in the  CDC  variants  of  interest  or  concern,  including  D614G,  E484K,  N501Y,  P681H,  P681R, ΔH69/V70, and ΔY144 (Figure S1). Further,  we  investigated  whether  a  class  of  mutations  (missense,  insertions  and/or deletions) is enriched for association with surges. We applied a stringent threshold for inferring the trends by ensuring that mutational prevalence and positivity data is present over the complete time-window  of  three  months.  This  reduced  the  number  of  mutations  from  857  to  255.    Interestingly,  we  observed  an  enrichment  of  deletion  mutation  in  the  surge  with  18  out  of  19 deletions associated with the surge (Figure 1c; Chi-square Test p-value = 7.7e-05; Odds Ratio = 41.8, 95% CI: 6.36-1758). These surge-associated deletions in the Spike protein occur exclusively in the N-terminal domain, which is interesting in light of the recently identified recurrent deletion regions (RDRs) in the N-terminal domain15. This raises the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be acquiring  deletion  mutations  to  evolve  new  variants  that  drive  the  surges  in  community transmission of COVID-19. Surging  SARS-CoV-2  variants  in  India  and  Chile  have  acquired  new  deletions  in  an antigenic supersite enabling evasion of neutralizing antibodiesRecently there have been massive surges of COVID-19 community transmission in a few countries around the world, but most prominentlyin India18and Chile19,20. In order to identify the mutations that are associated with these surges, we systematically analysed the mutations that increased  monotonically  in  prevalence  correlated  with  the  monotonic  increase  in  test  positivity between February and April 2021 (Figure 2a andFigure 3a). .

4In India, 13 Spike protein mutations were correlated with the massive surge (“second wave of infections'') in April 2021 (Table S1). The most prevalent mutations included D616G, L452R, P681R,  G142D  and  Q1071H  (Figure  2b andFigure  S2).Interestingly,  there  is  also  a  rapidly emerging deletion in the NTD (ΔF157/R158) that has increased 13.6 fold in prevalence from 1.1% (of 1254 sequences) in February 2021 to 15% (of 367 sequences) in April 2021. F157 and R158 reside in the antigenic supersite, which is recognized by a number of NTD-targeting neutralizing antibodies14,21(Figure 2b). Importantly, owing to the recent emergence of this deletion it had not been identified at the time of the prior characterization of Spike protein deletions15, and thus we suggest that ΔF157/R158 represents a novel distinct fifth recurrent deletion region. In Chile, 36 Spike protein mutations are correlated with the surge in April 2021 (Figure 3b, Table S2). Clustering these mutations by co-occurrences in sequences shows the emergence of a new variant characterized by a novel in-frame deletion resulting in the loss of residues 246-253  and  a  D253G  substitution (Δ246-253),  which  has  increased  38.4  fold  in    prevalence  from January  to  April  2020  (0.86%  to  33.0%)  (Figure  3b).  This  new  surging  variant  in  Chile  is independent of two other concurrently circulating variants: P.2 (first identified in Brazil) and B.1.1.7 (first identified in the UK) (Figure 3b). Interestingly, residues 246-253 are part of the “supersite loop” in the same NTD antigenic supersite that includes F157 and R158  (Figure 3b)14,21. Taken  together,  this  analysis  of  India  and  Chile  highlights  two  simultaneously  surging strains  in  different  parts  of  the  world  that  have  both  acquired  deletions  in  the  NTD  antigenic supersite  (ΔF157/R158  in  India,  Δ246-253  in  Chile)  that  is  highly  targeted  by  neutralizing antibodies.  Indeed,  deletions  in  the  NTD  domain  have  been  previously  shown  to  diminish  the binding  of  neutralizing  antibodies13,15.  This  suggests  that  the  surging  SARS-CoV-2 variants  in India  and  Chile  may  have  acquired  NTD  deletions  in  the  antigenic  supersite  in  order  to  evade neutralizing antibodies and achieve immune escape. Indeed, mutations in this region (at P251, G252,  and  D253)  were  also  found  in  neutralization  escape mutants in  vitro13.  From  a  viral evolution standpoint, these observations raise the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is expanding its repertoire of deletable regions in the Spike protein as the pandemic progresses.Recurrent deletion regions in the Spike protein emerge and expand over the course of the pandemicIn order to understand whether the deletable regions in the Spike protein are increasing, we  examined  the  distribution  of  deletion  frequencies  for  all  amino  acids  in  the  Spike  protein sequence from over 1.3 million sequences as of April 30, 2021(Figure 4a,b; see Methods). This analysis includes more than 10 fold the number of sequences compared to the previous analysis of  recurrent  deletion  regionsthat  was  based  on  146,795  sequences  as  of  October  24,  2020 (Figure 4a; see Methods). In addition to ΔF157/R158 (the new surge-associated  deletion  in  India; Figure  2),  we observed that residues 14-18 (QCVNL) are deleted more frequently than expected basedon the background distribution (see Methods). Interestingly, these residues are part of the N-terminal region of the same antigenic supersite (Figure 4a), and mutations in this region (at C15 and L18) were  common  among  neutralization  escape  mutants13,14.  Furthermore,  this  deletion  region  is emerging  recently —most  viral  genomes  containing  one or  more  deletions  in  this  region  were  .

5deposited  after  October,  202015.  We  also  identified  potential  recurring  deletions  at  residues S640/N641 and 675-681 (QTQTNSP), the latter of which directly precedes the Spike protein furin cleavage site that we and others have described previously22–25. It is notable that these are the only recurring deletion regions observed to date that are outside of the NTD (and thus outside of the antigenic supersite).We also recognized that recurrent deletion regions appear to have the capacity to expand (i.e., to involve more flanking amino acids) over time. For example, the Δ246-253 deletion in one of the surge associated Chile variants can be viewed as an expansion of the previously defined recurrent  deletion  region  RDR4  (Δ242-248)15(Figure  5b).  This  expansion  is  likely  of  high immunologic relevance, as not only do these residues map to the supersite loop, but mutations in this region (at P251, G252, and D253) were also found in neutralization escape mutants in vitro13. Further biochemical experiments can determine whether these previously uncharacterized NTD deletions (residues 14-18, 156-159, and 249-253) impact the binding of NTD-targeted neutralizing antibodies or the capacity of sera from vaccinated individuals to neutralize the virus.Taken together, our analysis highlights both the emergence of novel deletion regions and the expansion of previously defined deletion regions over the past several months. These should be monitored as candidates for emerging hotspots of deletion.Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from COVID-19 patients with vaccine breakthrough reveals the presenceof distinct deletions in the N-terminal domainThe genomic-epidemiology analysis presented above based on publicly accessible data has  shown  that  SARS-CoV-2 appears  to  be  acquiring  deletion  mutations  to  evade  neutralizing antibodies  and  that  the  deletable  regions  are  expanding  over  the  course  of  the  pandemic. However, the genome sequences deposited in publicly accessible databases (e.g. GISAID) lack any clinical or phenotypic annotations such as vaccination status or disease severity of the linked COVID-19  patients.  To  address  this,  we  performed  whole  genome  viral  sequencing  from  53 COVID-19 patients from the Mayo Clinic health system, for whom we have complete longitudinal health records and vaccination history. Of these, 20 cases were vaccine breakthrough infections, with the infected individuals having been fully vaccinated at the time of their positive SARS-CoV-2  test.  In  total,  we  identified  92  unique  mutations,  of  which  28  are  deletions  (Figure  5a).  All observed  Spike protein deletions  in  this  cohort occurred in the NTD, with Δ144 and ΔH69/V70 showing the highest prevalence (64% and 62%, respectively). Interestingly, we identified four Spike protein variants harboring one or more deletions that warranted follow up (Figure 5b). Two of these novel deletions (Δ156-164, ΔD88) were isolated from previously vaccinated individuals. Whether the deletions were already present at the times of infection or evolved within these individuals under the pressure of vaccine-induced immunity is not known. One patient who had received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine BTN162b2 in January 2021 was subsequently infected in April. The virus recovered from this patient contained a Δ156-164 deletion  (Figure 5b). Given the prominent ΔF157/R158 deletion in India, this corroborates our prior observation that recurrent deletion regions can expand and suggests that ΔF157/R158 may actually be part of a larger deletion-prone region. More importantly, the possibility that this variant  .

6with a large contiguous deletion within the antigenic supersite was able to infect a fully vaccinated individual mandates further characterization of the potential immuno-evasive effects of deletions in this region.In  another  breakthrough  infection  (Ad26.COV2.S),  a  patient  who  had  received  the  J&J vaccine in early April 2021 subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the end of the month. The  recovered  viral  genome  harbored  a  ΔD88  deletion  in  addition  to  ΔH69/V70 and  ΔY144 (Figure 5b). This ΔD88 deletion is quite rare, having been detected in only five of the 1.3 million total sequences deposited (as of April 30, 2021). That said, there was one unvaccinated individual in this Mayo Clinic cohort who experienced severe COVID-19 with a virus containing a ΔD85-90 deletion  (Figure  5b).  There  are  three  sequences  in  the  GISAID  database  containing  this  full stretch deletion, two of which are from Germany and one from Texas (Table S3). While still too rare to infer its future trajectory, deletions in this region should be epidemiologically monitored in the coming months, particularly to determine whether they impact vaccine effectiveness. Finally,   the   viral   genome   recovered   from   another   severe   COVID-19   case   in   an unvaccinated individual contained a Δ167-174 deletion (Figure 4b). While these residues are not withinthe antigenic supersite itself, they do reside in a loop proximal to it, the deletion of which would  almost  certainly  impact  the  three-dimensional  structure  of  the  supersite  (Figure  4c). Interestingly, residues 168-172 appear to be a potential emerging deletion hotspot in the GISAID dataset, only narrowly missing classification as a recurring deletion region based on our defined criteria (see Methods). Thus, this is a candidate region to emerge as a bonafide recurring deletion region in the near future.  This  real-time  genomic  surveillance  of  SARS-CoV-2  genomes  from  COVID-19  patients with linked phenotypic and clinical annotations greatly complements our analysis of the publicly accessible  unannotated  sequences.  Specifically,  we  have  identified  deletions  within  the  NTD antigenic supersite which are associated with vaccine breakthrough infections (e.g., Δ156-164), and we have identified other deletions in SARS-CoV-2 isolated from unvaccinated severe COVID-19 patients that could represent emerging recurring deletion regions (e.g., Δ167-174). Taken in the  context  of  previous  structural  and  experimental  studies,  these  deletion  patterns  seem  to represent a historical footprint and future trajectory of the antigenic minimalism strategy employed by SARS-SoV-2 to evade natural and vaccine-induced immunity.DiscussionThe  worldwide  mass  vaccination  campaign  has  had  a  profound  impact  on  COVID-19 transmission.  However,  certain  variants  are  less  susceptible  to  neutralization  by  sera  from vaccinated individuals and convalescent COVID-19 patients26,27. Such findings motivate the need to vigilantly track the emergence of new variants and to determine whether they are likely to cause surges  or  vaccine  breakthrough infections.  Here,  through  an  integrated  analysis  of  genomic-epidemiology  and  clinical  genomics,  we  found  that  (i)  deletions  are  strongly  associated  with surges  in  community  transmission  (ii)  deletions  in  the  Spike  protein  NTD  map  to  an  antigenic supersite,(iii) the repertoire of deletions in the Spike protein is expanding over the course of the pandemic  and  (iv)  deletions  are  present  in a  subset  of  vaccine  breakthrough  variants.  Indeed, deletion mutations are not operating independent of other mutation classes. In addition to deletion  .

7mutations, several substitution mutations are also associated with surges in cases (e.g. L452R and  T478K  in  the  receptor  binding  domain; Figure  S1).  Thus,  a  concerted  evolution  of strategically  placed  deletions  and substitutions  appears  to  be  conferring  SARS-CoV-2  with  the fitness to evade immunity and achieve efficient transmission between hosts (Figure 6).Our finding that Spike protein NTD deletions are strongly enriched for association with test positivity  surges  is  notable  in  the  context  of  a  previous  report  identifying  the  NTD  as  the  most common site of  deletions15. Specifically, this prior study highlighted four recurrent deletion regions in the NTD based on the GISAID data deposited as of October 2020 (146,795 total sequences). Several  of  these  regions  overlap  with  the  residues  of  the  recently  identified  NTD  antigenic supersite,  and  deletions  within  them  can  abrogate  binding  to  neutralizing  antibodies13–15.  Our findings build upon this prior work by examining the deletions which have arisen in the interim, during which over 1.1 million additional sequences have been deposited. In addition to validating the previously suggested definitions of recurrent deletion regions RDR1 (ΔH69/V70 and flanking deletions), RDR2 (ΔY144 and flanking deletions), and RDR3 (ΔI210 and ΔN211), we found that RDR4 (previously defined as positions 242-248) has recently expanded to include positions 249-253. These residues are indeed part of the structurally mapped supersite13,14, and a variant with the Δ246-253 deletion increased in prevalence during a recent test positivity surge in Chile. The recently evolved ΔF157/R158 deletion, which has expanded during the massive surge in India, marks a new recurrent deletion region which also maps to the supersite14. Finally, our real time surveillance of clinically annotated SARS-CoV-2 genomes among COVID-19 cases at the Mayo Clinic,  including  vaccine  breakthrough  infections,  revealed  contiguous  deletions  (Δ85-90  and Δ167-174) that have not been recognized as recurrent deletion regions previously. The proximity of these regions to the antigenic supersite suggests that they may become more prevalent and that  deletions  in  these  regions  should  be  monitored  for  associations  with  future  surges. The striking  trend  that  the  most  frequently  deleted  NTD  regions  are  proximal  to  a  single  antigenic supersite  highlights  the  prominent  role  that  host  immunity  has  played  in  shaping  the  genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from the beginning of this pandemic. There are a few limitations of this study. First, the geographic distribution of sequences deposited in the GISAID database is not representative of the global population, with amajority of  the  sequences  coming  from  the  United  States  or  the  United  Kingdom.  Future  genomic epidemiology  studies  would  be  improved  by  expanded  sequencing  efforts  in  other  countries. Second,  the  identification  of  mutations  associated  with  surges  during  early  months  of  the pandemic  is  complicated  by  the  relative  paucity  of  whole  genome  sequencing  data  deposited during  that  time.  Third,  the publicly  accessible  genomic data  is  generally not  linked  to  relevant phenotypic information (e.g., disease severity) or relevant medical histories (e.g., comorbidities and  vaccination  status).  Thus,  while  we  are  able  to  identify  correlations  between  mutational prevalence and case surges, we cannot determine whether particular mutations are associated with more severe disease or are observed more frequently than expected by chance in vaccinated individuals. While the latter shortcoming is partially addressed by our independent whole genome sequencing of virus isolated from COVID-19 cases with accessible longitudinal records(including previously vaccinated individuals), this analysis was limited by the small size of the cohort (n = 53) and  the  lack  of  corresponding  antibody  titer  data.  We  plan  to  perform  sequencing  of  more SARS-CoV-2 samples from COVID-19 patients. .

8Taken  together,  by  synthesizing  insights  from  genomic  epidemiology  and  clinical genomics, we have uncovered that SARS-CoV-2 likely employs antigenic minimalism in the Spike protein  as  a  strategy  to  evade  immune  responses  induced  by  infection  or  vaccination.  These findings  have  important  therapeutic  and  public  health  policy  implications.  The  repertoire  of deletion  mutations  in  the  N-terminal  domain  should  be  considered  when  developing  future vaccines and biologics to counter the immuno-evasive strategies of SARS-CoV-2. From the public health  standpoint,  we  must  expand  sequencing  efforts  around  the  world  and  encourage  the transparent  linking  of  relevant  deidentified  patient  phenotypic  data  (e.g.  disease  severity, vaccination status) to each deposited SARS-CoV-2 genome.While the current analysis focuses on  the  Spike  protein,  future  work  focusing  on  other  SARS-CoV-2  proteins,  such  as  the nucleocapsid protein and RNA-directed RNA polymerase, will shed light on the role of the overall mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2proteome for viral fitness and immune evasion. Such a holistic  understanding  of  the  mutational  landscape  of  SARS-CoV-2  is  imperative  to proactively predict  variants  that  could  trigger  outbreaks  and  vaccine  breakthroughs,  as  well  as  guide  the development of comprehensive therapeutic strategies to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsAnalysis of publicly deposited SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencesAround 1.57 million  SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (with 1,285 unique lineages and 10,298   unique   spike   mutations)   were   obtained   from   GISAID17(data   retrieved   from https://www.gisaid.org/as of 18th May 2021) across 187 countries/territories. Using the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence asreference (UniProt ID: P0DTC2), there have been 10,298 amino acid mutations in the Spike protein detected in at least one sequence. To filter out potential sequencing artifacts, we excluded mutations that were present in fewer than 100 sequences, resulting in 857 unique Spike protein mutations. Identification of surge-associated SARS-CoV-2 mutationsTo  identify  mutations  that  have  been  temporally  associated  with  surges  in  COVID-19 cases throughout the pandemic, we assessed monthly mutational prevalences and test positivity over three-month intervals in each country. For each of the 857 mutations, the monthly mutational prevalence was computed for a given country as:𝑀𝑢𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒=𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑚𝑢𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑑𝑒𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ×100Positivity  data  for  PCR  tests  was  obtained  from  the  OWID  resource28,29(retrieved  from https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/dataon   May   21,   2021).

9To identify surge-associated mutations, we classified the monthly mutational prevalence (for  each  mutation)  and  the  monthly  test  positivity  as  increasing  (monotonically),  decreasing (monotonically), or mixed over sliding three-month intervals over the course of the pandemic. Any mutation  which  monotonically  increased  in  prevalence  over  this  interval  in  a  country  with  a simultaneous monotonic increase in test positivity was defined as a “surge-associated mutation.” There were 89 such mutations.Comparison of surge-associated mutations to mutations in CDC variants of interest and concernIn order to test the value of our method, we obtained the set of CDC variants of interest and concern as of April 15, 20218. At this time, there were 5 variants of concern and 8 variants of interest, with no variants of high consequence. From the 13 classified variants, there 56 unique mutations listed, of which 25 were found only in variants of interest, 24 were found only in variants of concern, and 7 were found in both variants of interest and concern. After identifying the surge-associated  mutations  as  described  above,  we  determined  the  fraction of  mutations  comprising the CDC-classified variants which were captured by this approach. Assessment of mutation types for enrichment of surge-associated mutationsAfter  identifying  the  89  surge-associated  mutations,  we  tested  whether  any  of  the contributing  mutation  types  (deletions,  insertions,  or  substitutions)  were  enriched  for  surge-associated  mutations.  To  do  so,  we  constructed  a  2  x  3  table  giving  the  number  of  surge-associated and non-surge-associated mutations in each category. To determine whether one or more groups showed a statistically significant enrichment, a chi-square p-value was calculated using the chisq.test function from the stats package (4.0.3) in R. Post-hoc tests were performed by  considered  constructing  2x2  contingency  tables  to  compare  each  mutation  type  against  all others. Then, odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculatedusing the fisher.test function from the stats package (version 4.0.3) in R. Identification of new recurrent deletion regions in the Spike proteinRecurrent deletion regions (RDRs) were previously defined as four sites within the NTD to  which  over  90%  of  all  Spike  protein  deletions  occurred,  per  the  146,795  SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in GISAID as of October 24, 2020. To identify potential new RDRs that have emerged since this time, we first plotted the distribution of deletion counts for each amino acid (i.e. number of sequences in which deletion of the given amino acid was observed) in the Spike protein, considering all 1,313,962 sequences analyzed as of April 30, 2021. We calculated the 95th percentile of the deletion count distribution, which is 22.4. We then bucketed each residue Rinto categories (Yes, No, Possible) reflecting whether or not it should be considered as part of an  RDR  (i.e,  a  contiguous  stretch  of  two  or  more  amino  acid  residues  which  undergo  deletion events more frequently than expected by chance) as follows (illustrated schematically in Table S4).Once  each  residue  was  categorized  in  this  way,  then  any  residue Pin the “Possible” category were subjected to further analysis to convert their labels into “Yes” or “No.” Specifically, we  took  a  step-wise  approach,  walking  in  both  directions  from P until  the  first  encounter  of  a residue categorized as “Yes” or “No” (i.e., other residues labeled as “Possible” were ignored).

10a residue categorized as “Yes” was encountered before any residue categorized as “No” in either direction, then the “Possible” label was converted to “Yes.” If a residue categorized as “No” was encountered before any residue categorized as “Yes” in both directions, then the “Possible” label was converted to “Yes.” With  each  residue  categorized  as  “Yes”  or  “No”,  we  then  simply  merged  the  residue windows with consecutive “Yes” labels to define the updated set of Spike protein RDRs. We name the RDRs on the basis of the first and last amino acid residues contained within the region; for example, the RDR including residues C14, Q15, and V16 is defined as RDR14-16.Temporal analysis of expansions in recurrent deletion regionsTo  assess  the  expansion  of regions  undergoing  deletions  over  time,  we  plotted  a  time series heatmap indicating the first time (month) at which a given deletion was identified across all GISAID  sequences,  and  the  number  of  sequences  in  which  that  deletion  was  detected  in  that month and all subsequent months. The residues plotted were defined based on the definition of RDRs provided above, which builds upon the regions defined previously 15. Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteinStructural analyses and illustrations were performed in PyMOL (version 2.3.4). The cryo-EM structure of the Spike protein characterizing the interaction with a neutralizing antibody 4A8 (PDB identifier: 7C2L), described by Chi et al.21, was retrieved from the PDB.Amplicon sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome obtained from individuals with breakthrough infectionsThis  is  a  retrospective  study  of  individuals  who  underwent  polymerase  chain  reaction(PCR) testing for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Mayo Clinic and hospitals affiliated to the Mayo health system. This study was reviewed by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board and determined to be exempt from human subjects research. Subjects were excluded if they did not have a research authorization on file.SARS-CoV-2  RNA-positive  upper  respiratory  tract  swab  specimens  from  patients  with vaccine breakthrough or reinfection of COVID-19 were subjected to next-generation sequencing, using the commercially available Ion AmpliSeq SARS-CoV-2 Research Panel (Life Technologies Corp.,  South  San  Francisco,  CA)  based  on  the  ""sequencing  by  synthesis""  method.  The  assay amplifies 237 sequences ranging from 125 to 275 base pairs in length, covering 99% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Viral RNA was first manually extracted and purified from these clinical specimens using MagMAX™ Viral / Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Life Technologies Corp.), followed by automated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of viral sequences, DNA library preparation (including  enzymatic  shearing,  adapter  ligation,  purification,  normalization),  DNA  template preparation,  and  sequencing  on  the  automated  Genexus™  Integrated  Sequencer  (Life Technologies Corp.) with the Genexus™ Softwareversion  6.2.1.  A  no-template  control  and  a positive SARS-CoV-2 control were included in each assay run for quality control purposes.

Here, we systematically analyzed 1.57 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 187 countries/territories and performed whole-genome viral sequencing from 53 COVID-19 patients, including 20 vaccine breakthrough infections. We identified 89 Spike protein mutations that increased in prevalence during at least one surge in SARS-CoV-2  test  positivity  in  any  country  over  a  three-month  window.  Deletions  in  the  Spike protein   N-terminal  domain  (NTD)  are  highly  enriched  for  these  ‘surge-associated mutations’ (Odds Ratio = 41.8, 95% CI: 6.36-1758, p-value = 7.7e-05). In the recent COVID-19 surge in India, an NTD deletion (ΔF157/R158) increased over 10-fold in prevalence from February 2021 (1.1%) to April 2021 (15%). During the recent surge in Chile, an NTD deletion (Δ246-253)increased rapidly over 30-fold in prevalence from January 2021 (0.86%) to April 2021 (33%). Strikingly, these simultaneously emerging deletions associated with surges in different  parts  of  the  world  both  occur  at  an  antigenic  supersite  that  is  targeted  byneutralizing  antibodies.  Finally,  we  generated  clinically  annotated  SARS-CoV-2  whole genome sequences and identified deletions within this NTD antigenic supersite in a patient with vaccine breakthrough infection (Δ156-164)  and  other  deletions  from  unvaccinated severe COVID-19 patients that could represent emerging deletion-prone regions. Overall, the  expanding  repertoire  of  Spike  protein  deletions  throughout  the  pandemic  and  their association  with  case  surges  and  vaccine  breakthrough  infections  point  to  antigenic minimalism  as  an  emerging  evolutionary  strategy  for  SARS-CoV-2  to  evade  immune responses. This study highlights the urgent need to sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes at a larger  scale  globally  and  to  mandate  a  public  health  policy  for  transparent  reporting  of relevant clinical annotations  (e.g. vaccination status)  in  order to  aid  the  development  of comprehensive therapeutic strategies."
Real-world effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S adenoviral vector vaccine for COVID-19,"In  light  of  the  massive  and  rapid  vaccination  campaign  against  COVID-19, continuous  real-world  effectiveness  and  safety  assessment  of  the  FDA-authorized vaccines  is  critical  to  amplify  transparency,  build  public  trust,  and  ultimately  improve overall healthoutcomes. In this study, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records (EHRs) from the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system (MN, AZ, FL,  WN,  IA).  We  compared  the  infection  rate  of  2,195  individuals  who  received  a  single doseof the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to the infection rate of 21,950  unvaccinated,  propensity-matched  individuals  between  February  27th  and  April 14th 2021. Of the 1,779 vaccinated individuals with at least two weeks of follow-up, only 3 (0.17%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 15 days or more after vaccination compared to 128 of 17,744 (0.72%) unvaccinated individuals (4.34 fold reduction rate). This corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness of 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least two weeks after vaccination. This data is consistent with the clinical trial-reported  efficacy  of  Ad26.COV2.S  in  preventing  moderate  to  severe  COVID-19  with onset at least 14 days after vaccine administration (66.9%; 95% CI: 59.0-73.4%). Due to the recent   authorization   of   the   Ad26.COV2.S   vaccine,   there   are   not   yet   enough hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or deaths within this cohort to robustly assess the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 severity, but these outcomes will be continually assessed in near-real-time with our platform. Collectively, this study provides further evidence that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and reaffirms the urgent need to continue mass vaccination efforts globally. IntroductionTo date, there have been over 145 million cases of COVID-19 worldwide with over 3 million associated  deaths 1.  Following  the  Emergency  Use  Authorizations  by  the  Food  and  Drug Administration (FDA) on February 27, 2021, more than 6.8 million doses of the Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine (Johnson & Johnson, Janssen) have been administered in the United States 2.  This  vaccine  consists  of  a  single  dose  injection  of  a  recombinant,  replication-incompetent human adenovirus type 26 vector encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. A recent phase 3 trial has demonstrated its effectiveness (66.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0 to 73.4) and safety  profile 3.  Self-resolving  mild  to  moderate  adverse  effects  were  common  in  vaccinated participants, and serious adverse effects occurred rarely, with a frequency comparable to placebo 3. As the vaccines continue to be administered more broadly, it is critical to continuously evaluate safety and effectiveness data for various reasons. For example, the interpretation of vaccinetrial outcomes is inherently limited by how representative the studied population is of the broader population which will ultimately receive the vaccine. Further, effectiveness is a dynamic process  following  which  can  be  impacted  by  viral  evolution.  Variants  with  mutations  in  the  S protein regularly arise and may have the potential to escape the immune response triggered by the vaccine. Finally, the fraction of the population which has been vaccinated can influence the observed effectiveness through herd immunity.  .

Continuous  safety  assessment  is  equally,  if  not  more  important.  Treating  a  previously healthy  population  requires  extremely  strong  evidence  of  safety  (“do  not  harm”  principle),  as illustrated by the recent brief pause of Ad26.COV2.S use for safety review following reports of very rare thrombotic thrombocytopenia after vaccination 2. While systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) are quite valuable in unearthing rare or ultra rare side effects  at  the  incipient  stages 4,  they  rely  on  active  reporting,  inherently  biased  and  without appropriate control populations or any medical history on the associated patients.We have previously leveraged recent advances in deep neural networks to perform high throughput machine-augmented curation of electronic health record (EHR) systems 5,6. This has enabled  the  rapid  assessment  of  real  world  effectiveness  and  safety  of  the  mRNA  vaccines mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), as well as a targeted investigation of cerebral  venous  sinus  thrombosis  (CVST)  incidence  among  patients  receiving  COVID-19 vaccines (including Ad26.COV2.S) within the Mayo Clinic Health System 7–9. We believe such approaches are essential for vaccine development, deployment, and most importantly to build trust and transparency for the public. Here,  we  expand  on  this  effort  to  conduct  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the  real-world effectiveness  of  Ad26.COV2.S  vaccination  within  the  multi-state  Mayo  Clinic  Health  System (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, Wisconsin, Iowa) between February 27th and April 14th 2021.ResultsPrevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated populationBetween February 27th and April 14th 2021, a total of 2,195individuals who met the study inclusion criteria received the Ad26.COV2.s COVID-19 vaccine across the Mayo Clinic network (Methods and Figure 1A). To evaluate the effectiveness of this vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identified a cohort of 21,950 unvaccinated individuals using 1:10 propensity score  matching  (see Methods and Table  1).  During  this  time  interval,  13  of  2,195  (0.59%) vaccinated individuals have had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test compared to 262 of 21,950 (1.19%) unvaccinated individuals (Table 2). The incidence rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in the  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  cohorts  were  0.18  and  0.36  cases  per  1000  person-days, respectively, indicating an overall vaccine effectiveness of 50.6% (95% CI: 14.0-74.0%) (Table 2). The full effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S is expected to be achieved after several weeks 3. Thus, we next analyzed the incidence rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests starting 15 days after the  study  enrollment  date.  During  this  time,  3  of  1,779  (0.17%)  vaccinated  individuals  tested positive  compared  to  128  of  17,744  (0.72%)  unvaccinated  individuals.  This  corresponds  to  a vaccine effectiveness of 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infectionwith onset at least two weeks after vaccination (Table 2). Consistent with this, Kaplan-Meier analysis to investigate hazard reduction after receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine shows that the curves split approximately 14 days after injection (Figure 2A-B). .

Infection can occur after vaccination if an individual is exposed to SARS-CoV-2 shortly after  vaccination  (i.e.,  before  building  immunity)  or  if  the  vaccinate  fails  to  elicit  protective immunity. In order to distinguish between the two, we analyzed the distribution of time between study enrollment and the fist positive PCR test in these two cohorts(Figure 3). The median time to positive PCR test following vaccination was 7 days, with 10 of 13 infections occurring within the  first  two  weeks.  For  the  unvaccinated  individuals,  the  median  time  to  positive  PCR  test following  enrollment  date  was  14  days.  These  results  suggest  that  most  infections  in  the vaccinated  cohort  are  likely  due  to  viral  exposure  before  the  recipient  was  able  to  develop immunity rather than failure of the vaccine itself. Rate of severe COVID-19 disease following Ad26.COV2.s vaccinationTo  understand  effectiveness  in  preventing  severe  COVID-19  (hospitalization,  ICU admission, and death), we first compared the rate of hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality between the 13 infected vaccinated individuals and the 262 infected unvaccinated individuals. No difference in hospitalization rate, ICU admission rates were observed. A difference in mortality trended  towards  the  end  of  the  follow-up  period  but  there  was  not  enough  time  to  reach significance (Figure 4).Currently, vaccination is prioritized towards older and at-risk individuals, which biases the comparison with the unvaccinated cohort (younger, healthier). In order to control for this bias, we designed a cohort of unvaccinated patients matching the 13 vaccinated patents that were infected by SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination (Figure 1B, Methods). Using 1:10 propensity score matching, the cohort was matched based on demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), and risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness provided by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention 10(see Methods). We then compared the 14-day rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality between these cohorts (Table S3). While we did not observe any significant differences in these outcomes, it is important to note that only 5 vaccinated COVID-19 patients had sufficient follow up (14 days) for inclusion in this analysis. This cohort is not yet large enough to robustly assess the impact of Ad26.COV2.S on COVID-19 severity, as we estimate that 149 events within 14 days would be required to detect a difference of 85% in hospitalization, ICU admission, or mortality with astatistical power of 80%.  DiscussionIn  this  study,  we  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  Ad26.COV2.S  COVID-19  vaccine (Johnson & Johnson, Janssen) in a real world setting by analyzing longitudinal health records of 2,195 vaccinated individuals and a 1:10 propensity matched unvaccinated cohort in the multi-state Mayo Clinic Health System (MN, AZ, FL, WN, IA). We observed significant reductions in rates of newly diagnosed COVID-19 infection, with an overall effectiveness of 48.8% (95% CI: 10.8-73.1%)  and  an effectiveness  of  76.1%  (95%  CI:  28.4-95.1%)  starting  14  days  after vaccination. These findings are consistent with the results of the phase 3 trial of Ad26.COV2.S, which demonstrated 66.9% efficacy against moderate to severe COVID-19 with onset at least 14days after vaccination 3.  .

Clinical  trials  have  demonstrated  that  multiple  COVID-19  vaccines,  including Ad26.COV2.S, are highly efficacious in reducing the risk of severe illness. However, because only 13 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after receiving Ad26.COV2.S in our study, we were underpowered to assess an impact on COVID-19 severity in this population. As the vaccine is administered to more patients, we will continue to assess rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among individuals who become infected after Ad26.COV2.S vaccination. This study has several limitations. First, the study was conducted using data from a single health system, with the vast majority of analyzed individuals residing in Minnesota or Wisconsin. The  cohorts,  which  are  over  90% Caucasian  and  approximately  54%  female,  are  not demographically representative of the broader United States population that is now eligible for vaccination (Table 1). Second, the cohort analyzed is relatively small compared to the population analyzed in the phase 3 trial of Ad26.COV2.S and compared to our prior real world analyses of FDA-authorized mRNA vaccines 3,7. Finally, we did not assess the safety profile of Ad26.COV2.S here. It should be noted that we have previously performed a targeted investigation which showed that no individuals in the Mayo Clinic health system who received this vaccine have yet developed CVST, but this finding should also be taken in context of the very limited cohort size. Despite these caveats, this study is the first propensity matched real-world effectiveness assessment of Ad26.COV2.S. Implementation of this framework will allow us to track in real time how the effectiveness of this one-shot vaccine continues to evolve over the coming weeks. The extraction of such data from holistic health records inference is critical in shaping the global race against the ongoing pandemic. This information is particularly important in the context of variant emergence that could potentially escape vaccine-induced immunity. In addition, the recent brief pause in Ad26.COV2.S administration to analyze its safety highlights the value for independent analysis and better communication about vaccines, to ensure transparency and encourage trust in a life-saving procedure for our communities. MethodsStudy design and participantsThis  is  a  retrospective  study  of  individuals  who  underwent  polymerase  chain  reaction (PCR) testing for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Mayo Clinic and hospitals affiliated with the Mayo Clinic Health System. This study was reviewed by the Mayo ClinicInstitutional Review Board  (IRB)  and  determined  to  be  exempt  from  the  requirement  for  IRB  approval  (45  CFR 46.104d, category 4). Subjects were excluded if they did not have a research authorization on file.The participant selection algorithm for this study mirrors that outline in our previous real world  effectiveness  analysis  of  mRNA  COVID-19  vaccines 7.  Specifically  in  this  retrospective study, patients were included with the following criteria: (1) underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at the Mayo Clinic Health system in 2020-2021;  (2) at least 18 years old; (3) resides in a local (based on Zip code) in which at least 10 patients who have received the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.  .

Exclusion criteria were: (1) positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before the date of vaccine administration or the beginning of the study period (Feb 27, 2021) (2) individuals with zero follow-up  days  after  vaccination  (i.e.  those  who  received  the  vaccine  dose  on  the  last  date  of  data collection);   (3)   individuals   vaccinated   with   mRNA-1273   (Moderna)   or   BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and (4) no research authorization on file. After applying these inclusion and exclusion criteria, the study population included 2,195 vaccinated and 124,377 unvaccinated patients (Figure 1A). Further selection of the unvaccinated cohort was performed to match the vaccinated population: see sections below on the propensity score matching procedure. Effectiveness analysis (SARS-CoV-2 infection rate)Propensity score matching procedure defining the unvaccinated cohort We  employed  1:10  propensity  score  matching 11to  construct  an  unvaccinated  cohort similar to the vaccinated cohortwith respect to key risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as was described previously 7: (i) geography (zip code of the patient’s residence), (ii) demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), (iii) and records of PCR testing (number of negative PCR tests taken before December 1st, 2020.  As described previously, the number of negative PCR tests intends to capture a combination of factors including potential exposure levels to COVID-19 along with the willingness  and  ability  to  undergo  SARS-CoV-2  testing.  Propensity  scores  were  obtained  by training  regularized  logistic  regression  models  for  each  zip  code  using  the  software  package sklearn v0.20.3 in Python.Using these propensity scores, we matched each of the 2,195 individuals in the previously defined vaccinated cohort with 10 patients out of the 124,377 eligible unvaccinated individuals, using greedy nearest-neighbor matching without replacement 12. It should be noted that if an unvaccinated  individual  tested  positive  for  SARS-CoV-2  prior  to  the  vaccination  date  for  a potential matched vaccinated individual, this was considered an invalid match; in such cases, the unvaccinated individual was recycled (i.e. made available to potentially match to other vaccinated individuals) and a new unvaccinated individual was selected from the pool.Evaluation of vaccine effectivenessVaccine  effectiveness  was  evaluated  as  described  previously 7.  For  each  vaccinated individual, the date of study enrollment (Day 0) was defined as the date of vaccine administration. For each unvaccinated individual, the date of study enrollment was defined as the date of the vaccineadministration for their matched vaccinated individual. Cumulative  proportional  incidence  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  was  compared  between vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  patients  by  Kaplan  Meier  analysis.  Cumulative  proportional incidence at time t is the estimated proportion of patients who experience the outcome on or before time t, i.e. 1 minus the standard Kaplan-Meier survival estimate. We considered cumulative incidence starting at Day 1, Day 14 relative to the date of study enrollment (Day 0). Statisticalsignificance was assessed with the log rank test. .

We calculated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests between the vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  cohorts.  Effectiveness  was  defined  as  100%  x  (1 -IRR).  We considered the incidence rate starting on (i) Day 1 after vaccination, (ii) Day 8 after vaccination, and (iii) Day 15 after vaccination. Incidence rates were defined as the number of patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the given time period divided by the total number of at-risk person-days contributed in that time period. For each individual, at-risk person-days are defined as the number of days in the time period in which the individual has not yet tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or died. The IRR was calculated as the incidence rate of the vaccinated cohort divided by the incidence rate of the unvaccinated cohort, and its 95% confidence interval was computed using an exact approach described previously 13.Severe COVID19 after vaccination Propensity score matching procedure defining the unvaccinated cohort We  applied  1:10  propensity  score  matching  to  construct  a  SARS-CoV-2  positive unvaccinated  cohort  similar  in  baseline  clinical  covariates  to  the  cohort  of  patients  who  were vaccinated and subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were matched based on demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), comorbidities (asthma, cancer, cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension,  obesity,  pregnancy,  severe  obesity,  sickle  cell  disease,  solid  organ  transplant, stroke / cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus). This list of comorbidities was derived from the list of risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness provided by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention 10. We used deep neural networks to automatically identify comorbidities from the clinical notes, which are described in the next section. To obtain the propensity scores, we trained a regularized logistic regression model with these features using the software package sklearn v0.20.3 in Python.Based on these propensity scores, we matched each of the 13 individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination with 130 individuals out of the 262 individuals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and that were not vaccinated, using greedy nearest-neighbor matching without replacement. The resulting cohorts are summarized in Table S2, along with the SMDs for the clinical covariates that were balanced upon. There were no significant differences between the two cohorts in any of the clinical covariates that were included in propensity score matching (with SMD < 0.1 for all covariates). For each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, the index date for the analysis (day 0) was taken to be the date of the first positive PCR test. Clinical outcomes at 14 days were compared, including hospital admission,ICU admission, and mortality.Disease severity analysisAnalysis was performed with patients in each cohort with at least 14 days of follow-up after their first positive PCR test (n = 5 vaccinated, 165 unvaccinated). The following parameters were  . CC-BY 4.0 International licenseIt is made available under a  is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

evaluated: (1) 14-day hospital admission rate: Number of patients admitted to the hospital in the two weeks following their positive PCR test, (2) 14-day ICU admission rate: Number of patients admitted to the ICU in the two weeks following their positive PCR test, and (3) 14-day mortality rate: Number of patients deceased in the two weeks following their positive PCR test. For each outcome,  we  report  the  relative  risk  (rate  in  the  vaccinated  cohort  divided  by  the  rate  in  the matched unvaccinated cohort), 95% confidence interval for the relative risk, and Fisher’s exact test p-value. Hospital-free and ICU-free survival were also compared via Kaplan-Meier analysis, with statistical significance assessed with the log rank test.Automated clinical data extraction fromclinical notesWe  used  our  previously  described  BERT-based  neural  network  model  to  identify comorbidities from the electronic health record for each patient and classify the sentiment for the phenotypes  that  appeared  in  the  clinical  notes 14.  Briefly,  we  applied  a  phenotype  sentiment classification model that had been trained on 18,500 sentences which achieves an out-of-sample accuracy of 93.6% with precision and recall scores above 95%. This classification model predicts four classes, including: (1) “Yes”: confirmed diagnosis (2) “No”: ruled-out diagnosis, (3) “Maybe”: possibility of disease, and (4) “Other”: alternate context (e.g. family history of disease). For each patient, we applied the sentimentmodel to the clinical notes in the Mayo Clinic electronic health record. For each comorbidity phenotype, if a patient had at least one mention of the phenotype during the time period with a confidence score of 90% or greater, then the patient was labelledas having the phenotype.","In  this  study,  we  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  Ad26.COV2.S  COVID-19  vaccine (Johnson & Johnson, Janssen) in a real world setting by analyzing longitudinal health records of 2,195 vaccinated individuals and a 1:10 propensity matched unvaccinated cohort in the multi-state Mayo Clinic Health System (MN, AZ, FL, WN, IA). We observed significant reductions in rates of newly diagnosed COVID-19 infection, with an overall effectiveness of 48.8% (95% CI: 10.8-73.1%)  and  an effectiveness  of  76.1%  (95%  CI:  28.4-95.1%)  starting  14  days  after vaccination.

In this study, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records (EHRs) from the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system (MN, AZ, FL,  WN,  IA).  We  compared  the  infection  rate  of  2,195  individuals  who  received  a  single doseof the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to the infection rate of 21,950  unvaccinated,  propensity-matched  individuals  between  February  27th  and  April 14th 2021. Of the 1,779 vaccinated individuals with at least two weeks of follow-up, only 3 (0.17%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 15 days or more after vaccination compared to 128 of 17,744 (0.72%) unvaccinated individuals (4.34 fold reduction rate). This corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness of 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least two weeks after vaccination. This data is consistent with the clinical trial-reported  efficacy  of  Ad26.COV2.S  in  preventing  moderate  to  severe  COVID-19  with onset at least 14 days after vaccine administration (66.9%; 95% CI: 59.0-73.4%). Due to the recent   authorization   of   the   Ad26.COV2.S   vaccine,   there   are   not   yet   enough hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or deaths within this cohort to robustly assess the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 severity, but these outcomes will be continually assessed in near-real-time with our platform. Collectively, this study provides further evidence that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and reaffirms the urgent need to continue mass vaccination efforts globally."
Building a Best-in-Class Automated De-identification Tool for Electronic Health Records Through Ensemble Learning,"The natural language portions of  electronic health records (EHRs) communicate criticalinformation about disease and treatment progression. However, the presence of personallyidentifiable information (PII) in this data constrains its broad reuse. Despite continuousimprovements in methods for the automated detection of PII, the presence of residual identifiersin clinical notes requires manual validation and correction. However, manual intervention is nota scalable solution for large EHR datasets. Here, we describe an automated de-identificationsystem that employs an ensemble architecture, incorporating attention-based deep learningmodels and rule-based methods, supported by heuristics for detecting PII in EHR data. Upondetection of PII, the system transforms these detected identifiers into plausible, though fictional,surrogates to further obfuscate any leaked identifier. We evaluated the system with a publiclyavailable dataset of 515 notes from the I2B2 2014 de-identification challenge and a dataset of10,000 notes from the Mayo Clinic. In comparison with other existing tools consideredbest-in-class, our approach outperforms them with a recall of 0.992 and 0.994 and a precision of0.979 and 0.967 on the I2B2 and the Mayo Clinic data, respectively.

The automatedde-identification system presented here can enable the generation of de-identified patient dataat the scale required for modern machine learning applications to help accelerate medicaldiscoveries. We randomly sampled 10,000 notes, which were reduced to the set of unique sentences. Thisyielded a test set of 172,102 sentences. These were subsequently annotated by six Mayo Clinicnurse abstractors to create a ground truth label for every word and/or phrase. Each sentencewas annotated by at least two different nurse abstractors. The inter-annotator agreement onlabelling a token as PII had a Cohen’s Kappa of 0.9694​​(see Supplementary Methods fordetails).An additional set of 10,000 notes were selected to fine-tune the models. We manually annotated61,800 unique sentences from these notes to create a tagged fine-tuning set. SeeSupplementary Methods for more details.Detection of PII entitiesThe ensemble architecture described in this section leverages state of the art attention-baseddeep learning models in conjunction with rules harvested from the data (each of which isdescribed below) to handle semi-structured text. ​(Fig. 2)Fig. 2​ Sentence-based inclusion lists and template matching prune out sentences that either 1) lackPII or 2) contain PII in specific well-defined patterns. An ensemble of attention-based neuralnetworks identify complementary features across different PII types. For each entity type, multiplemodel versions (v​1​, v​2​, ... , v​N​) are used in tandem. Additionally, pattern recognition modules andstructured EHR content from matched patients support the anonymization process. The results fromeach component of the ensemble are aggregated to yield the original note labelled with PII tags.10All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

There are several salient features of this approach that are worth noting.Hybrid Deep Learning Models:​ The newer breed of attention based deep learning models, inconjunction with transfer learning, allow for faster tuning of these models with significantlysmaller sets of labeled data for detecting PII identifiers. We use pre-trained language modelsbased on the BERT​16​ architecture that are then fine tuned for detecting (a) personal names, (b)organizations, (c) locations, and (d) ages. We employed the bert-base-cased model(​https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased​) through the HuggingFace/Transformers(​https://github.com/huggingface/transformers​) library. This is a case-sensitive English languagepre-trained model based off of the BERT architecture trained using a masked languagemodelling (MLM) objective. The fine-tuning process involves training the pre-trained languagemodel on a named entity recognition task using a training set of annotated sentences. We useda total of 61,800 tagged example sentences to fine-tune the models. We fine-tuned eachtransformer model with a maximum sequence length of 256 (after tokenization) over 4 epochs.We use a training batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 5e-5 with a warmup proportion of 0.4.We then evaluated the model on a validation dataset and computed the accuracy. Weperformed the fine-tuning and model validation processes in an iterative manner (seeSupplementary Methods and ​Supplementary Table 1​ for complete implementation details).Identifiers such as names, locations, organizations and ages are well suited to a statistical entityrecognition method because they can use the context of the surrounding text to disambiguatethe entity type of a word. By contrast, pattern matching rules are significantly hampered in thisrespect. It would be hard, for instance, to detect “Glasgow” as a medical term in “He had nohelmet and his Glasgow Score was 6” and as a location in “Mr. Smith had visited his family inGlasgow using lookup dictionaries.However, we use patterns to deterministically tag reasonably well-defined PII identifiers, whichare almost entirely context independent and unambiguous. This category includes dates andtimes, phone and pager numbers, clinical IDs and numeric identifiers, email, URLs, IPaddresses, and vehicle numbers. In addition, harvested sentence templates (described furtherbelow) are relied upon to deterministically tag PII instances matched by the template patterns.Our methods apply to content in both structured (e.g lab comments) and free form text (e.gprogress notes).Additionally, it should be noted that we designed our method to detect and transform informationabout those who provide care, such as physicians, nurses, and pharmacies. Though this is notrequired by HIPAA Safe Harbor, it allows healthcare organizations to protect the identities oftheir employees as well.Ensemble of models framework and iterative fine tuning: ​Given the regulatory necessity ofextremely high recall for de-identification, we aggregate the results of multiple models trained forthe same PII type. Our ensemble involved employing at least one individual model for names,organizations, locations and ages (see ​Supplementary Table 2​). An additional text normalizedmodel was also trained and utilized for names​. ​In this respect, if a term is detected as PII in anyof the models for that type, then it is tagged. A divide and conquer approach has beenimplemented that harnesses the power of multiple models to identify PII or extract meaningfulentities (​Fig. 2​). In contrast to a “one size fits all” model, this approach enables each individualmodel to be fine-tuned to learn different (and complementary) features of the unstructured EHRdata as has been shown to be used in prior de-identification systems​23​. For instance, one modelfocuses on identifying peoples’ names while another is geared towards addresses andlocations.11All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Furthermore, there are additional models corresponding to cased and uncased variants of theraw data (referred to as “​Name Model 1​” and “​Name Model 2​” in ​Fig. 2​). Each model herecorresponds to an attention-based deep neural network. One advantage of carving out the entityspace to be handled individually by separate models is that each model needs to only learn thedistribution of entities of a specific type as opposed to all entities. However, this introduces achallenge in resolving terms in a sentence that have conflicting and/or ambiguous entity types.These conflicts are resolved in the aggregation phase of our ensemble where a simple votingthreshold of one claim is employed (i.e., an entity is considered PII even if one model in thesystem tags it as such). Since the majority of the components in the ensemble are designed todetect complementary features, we are able to improve recall without much loss of precision.Integrating databases as part of core model:​​We use publicly available databases of names,locations, and addresses to supplement the model fine-tuning process. ​First names withsupporting gender information were downloaded from the US Census database. Cities acrossthe US as well as lists of hospitals were obtained from Wikipedia. These public databases wereused to augment training of our models.​In addition, patient-specific information from structuredEHRs, including patient names and residential addresses, are used to augment the modeltraining and match against PII in the text.Sentence-based inclusion list:​ Clinical note corpora contain a large number of repeatedsentences. These stem from various processes, including automated reminders (e.g., “​Pleaselet your doctor know if you have problems taking your medications​”), repeated phrases in thewriting style of physicians (e.g. “​Rubella: Yes​”, “​Pain symptoms: No​”) or shared elements in theclinical notes such as section headers (e.g. “​History of Present Illness​”). From the corpus ofphysician notes from the Mayo Clinic, a set of 1,600 sentences, that did not contain PII, wereincorporated into an “inclusion list”. This inclusion list was further expanded with a set of 25,000sentences containing medically relevant entities, such as disease or drug names (seeSupplementary Methods for details on how the inclusion list was constructed). This has theadded benefit of improving the precision of the de-identification system because it reduces therisk of misclassifying these important entities as PII by the neural network models. Additionally,sentences marked as being devoid of PII during the validation phase in the iterative fine-tuningprocess are also added to the inclusion list (see Supplementary Methods).Auto-Generating templates using statistical NER models: ​In addition to exact sentenceswith high prevalence there are also a large number of PII containing sentences that can bemapped to a template (e.g., ​“Electronically signed by: SMITH, JOHN C on 01/02/1980 at 12:12PM CST”​ maps to a template of the form “​Electronically signed by: <LAST NAME>, <FIRSTNAME> <INITIAL> on <DATE> at <TIME>”​). While machine learning NER models can betrained and/or fine tuned to learn these patterns, there are instances where entity recognitionfails. So, though a name of the form “SMITH, JOHN C” might be detected, “DEWEY” in“DEWEY, JONES K” may not be detected. By contrast, regular expression rules faithfully matchevery PII for these cases.The problem, however, is that the process of identifying such templates and generating thecorresponding regular expressions is an arduous task because it involves manual inspection ofa sufficiently large sample of sentences in the corpus. Here, we use the NER ensemble modelsdesigned for the detection of PII to aid in the harvesting of these pattern templates. Sentencesfrom our fine-tuning set of 10,000 notes are passed through the ensemble and detected PII istransformed to its corresponding IOB2 (Inside-outside-beginning) mask (e.g., ​“Electronicallysigned by: B-PER I-PER I-PER on B-DATE at B-TIME PM CST”​) generating a potential NER12All rights reserved.

template. Additionally, a ‘syntax template’ for these sentences is also generated, such that anyterm that was detected as an entity is mapped to its syntactic representation - one of ‘W’ foralphabets only, ‘N’ for numbers only and ‘A’ for alphanumeric (e.g., ​“Electronically signed by: W,W W on N/N/N at N:N PM CST”​ ). Finally, for each unique syntax template, if there exists onlyone NER template amongst all instances of the syntax template, a regular expression rule isgenerated (e.g ​“Electronically signed by: [A-Za-z]+, [A-Za-z]+ [A-Za-z]+ on \d+/\d+/\d+ at \d+:\d+PM CST” ​) by mapping each syntax token to its corresponding regular expression pattern - ‘W’to ‘[A-Za-z]+’, ‘N’ to ‘\d+’ and ‘A’ to ‘\w’.Transformation of tagged PII entitiesThe de-identification process is designed to recognize words and phrases that represent PII andother sensitive elements with high recall. However, if the input text is transformed to thede-identified version by ​redacting​ detected PII, undetected PII (e.g., ‘Hayley’ and the date ‘7/21’in ​Fig. 3​) is obviously leaked to any person who reads the document. As such, the obfuscationprocess aims to conceal these residual PII by ​replacing​ detected PII with suitable surrogates soit is difficult to distinguish between the residual PII and the surrogates​21,24,25​. This method hasbeen implemented in several de-identification approaches​26,27​. As highlighted in ​Fig. 3​, it isdifficult for a human to determine which of “Jack Michaels” or “Hayley” is a leaked instance of PIIin the output of the replacement strategy using this mechanism of Hiding in Plain Sight (HIPS)​28​.Evidence with human readers has shown that when the recall of a natural language processingtool is high (i.e., when most real identifiers are detected), the rate of distinguishing real from filleridentifiers is no better than what one would encounter by random chance. It has further beenshown, however, that under highly controlled conditions, it is possible for a machine learningsystem to replicate the behavior of the natural language de-identification tool to remove fillersand leave real identifiers in place​28,29​.Fig. 3​ An illustration of the hiding in plain sight (HIPS) mechanism to highlight the utility of the detect→ replace strategy. After obfuscation, distinguishing real PII from surrogates is no better than whatone would expect by random chance.13All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In addition to employing the HIPS method, we apply entity-specific rules and heuristics toimprove the fidelity of the surrogate. We further improve interpretability of the output by ensuringthat every unique PII token in all EHR records for a patient has the same transformation.Consider the input text “​John Smith, a pleasant 67 year old presented with his son Jack. Johncomplains of breathing difficulty​” was transformed to “​Jane Kate, a pleasant 67 year oldpresented with his son Matt. Ryan complains of breathing difficulty​.” In this example, “​JaneKate​” as a surrogate is an obvious giveaway that it is a fake name and therefore lends itself tobe distinguished from any true PII that may have leaked. Furthermore, it appears that a thirdcompletely different person is complaining of breathing difficulty. So an ideal transformationwould have maintained the format of first name followed by last name and the gender for “JohnSmith” and every instance of “​John​” or “​Smith​” in the input would be transformed to the sameoutput; something like “​Jacob Hamilton, a pleasant 67 year old presented with his son David.Jacob complains of breathing difficulty​.”As discussed, we manage the replacement of surrogates per entity type (see ​SupplementaryTable 2​). Names are transformed in a manner that is consistent with format, gender andethnicity of the original (i.e., “​Ms. Lopez visited New York General Hospital for her routinecheckup”​ becomes “​Ms. Hernandez visited Mass General Hospital for her routine checkup”​).Dates are handled in a way to preserve their formatting (i.e., “​March 5th, 2014​” becomes“​February 27th, 2014​” and “​03-05-2014​” becomes “​02-27-2014​”). The shift in the date is apatient-specific random number. This ensures that dates are shifted consistently for a givenpatient. Locations and organizations are replaced with suitable surrogates chosen from apredefined dictionary. PII entities that contain numeric digits (such as phone number or patientID) involve replacing these numbers randomly while maintaining overall length and format.While the transformation output of an input token is the same for all instances of its occurrencefor a given patient, they would be different across patients. That is, while all instances of “John”in one patient might be transformed to “Jacob” for another patient it could be “Aaron”.Discussion and Future WorkNumerous approaches to de-identification have been developed. Automated de-identificationsystems can broadly be segmented into four categories: (i) rule-based systems, (ii) traditionalmachine learning systems, (iii) deep learning systems and (iv) hybrid and ensemble systems.Rule-based systems​19,20,30–32​ use pattern matching rules, regular expressions, dictionary andpublic database lookups to identify PII elements. These are simple to implement and usuallydeterministic; however, these systems have several drawbacks. First, pattern matching rules foridentifiers are typically not robust for handling variance in input due to typographicalerrors(spelling, punctuation, casing etc.); A rule that matches ​“Dr. John”​ may not be able tomatch ​“Dr john”​. Second, creating template patterns to match sentence fragments like ​“ProviderName: Dr. John”​ that tag any term after ​“Provider Name: Dr.”​ as a name, for example, requiresmanual effort to understand the data to create these templates. Doing this for large data setswith notes for millions of patients is time consuming and intractable. Third, dictionary-based14All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

systems may not be complete, resulting in increased ‘false negatives’ (i.e. true PII that is notdetected). Fourth, blindly using dictionary/database lookups induces ‘false positives’ becausethey tag phrases that are not identifiers in the context in which they are used that need to bedisambiguated​33​. For example, in ​“The doctor determined his Braden Score as normal”​, the term“Braden” might be flagged as PII, when it is only a clinical term​.Traditional Machine Learning (ML) systems​21,34–36​use traditional machine learning (ML)algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs), toperform NER classification as PII for each word in a sentence. The classification task involvescreating labeled data and defining features based on properties like part of speech (POS) tags,typography (e.g., capitalization, casing, spacing, font weights, or font types), punctuation, andfrequency of words and/or their neighbors. These methods, in addition to requiring significanteffort in encoding the feature vectors, may not generalize across datasets.Deep Learning systems​18​, ​have become the state-of-the-art for a wide variety of applicationdomains, including vision (e.g., image classification) and speech (e.g., voice recognition andgeneration). In language-related tasks (e.g machine translation), these approaches havesurpassed human level performance​37​. Deep learning has proven beneficial in numerous NLPtasks, including predicting the next word (language modeling), tagging tasks such as part ofspeech tags, entities in a sentence (entity recognition), and dependency parsing. This hasenabled applications that traditionally required custom rules and hand-crafted features to besolved without any feature engineering. ​Modern deep learning approaches for de-identificationhave been shown to outperform their predecessors​18​, but they require very large quantities ofdomain specific labeled training data to perform well. Specifically, the challenges include, butare not limited to, the presence of long and highly descriptive sentences, usage of clinicalshorthand (that vary across physicians and medical specialties), and a variety of semi-structuredmachine generated content. Moreover, publicly available datasets for de-identification (includingthe popular i2b2 2014 dataset​17​) lack diversity, often focusing on only a few types of notes orareas of disease. Training and benchmarking with such datasets is likely to bias the resultingmodels and fail to capture the nuanced and complex nature of physician notes. Recently,attention-based neural network (transformer) models have also been implemented forde-identification but have shown limited generalizability in the absence of support from encodedrules​38​.Hybrid​39​ and Ensemble Systems​40,41​ use combinations of rule-based and machinelearning-based components in tandem to improve PII detection efficacy. With these approaches,the choice of components, finding the right split of tasks between them and the optimal strategyfor combining results from them become crucial. Some approaches​42​ invoke engineeringpost-processing layers that fix the errors that are introduced by other (earlier) components.

graph. In the de-identification process, this could be used to recover biological terms incorrectlytagged as PII (false positives). Second, the quality of sentences that are provided to the modelcan be improved. Unstructured clinical text does not always contain well-formatted textcommonly due to missing punctuations and incorrect casing. A case-sensitive pre-trained modelalong with a masked-language model objective can be used to train a system capable ofcorrectly introducing punctuation in the right location. Another challenge with the quality ofclinical documents is the prevalence of short fragments and bullet points giving rise tosentences with poor context. Context of a single sentence can be expanded using precedingand succeeding sentences or employing document level transformer models such asTransformer-XL​43​. Third, unsupervised methods can be incorporated to accelerate theannotation process of the NER task. Grouping the word representations generated by atransformer model yields informative clusters (e.g. a cluster of names) that can be annotatedaccording to the nature of words present in the cluster. The NER task can then be formulated asa mask language task, where the overlap of the list of potential candidates for a missing wordwith the clusters can inform the entity type of the missing word.ConclusionOverall, this work implemented an ensemble approach to de-identification of unstructured EHRdata incorporating transformer models supported by heuristics for automatically identifying PIIacross diverse clinical note types. Upon detection, suitable surrogates replaced PII in theprocessed text thereby concealing residual identifiers (hiding in plain sight). The systemdemonstrates high precision and recall on both publicly available datasets and a large anddiverse dataset from the Mayo Clinic.","Numerous approaches to de-identification have been developed.

However, manual intervention is not a scalable solution for large EHR datasets. Here, we describe an automated de-identification system that employs an ensemble architecture, incorporating attention-based deep learning models and rule-based methods, supported by heuristics for detecting PII in EHR data. Upon detection of PII, the system transforms these detected identifiers into plausible, though fictional, surrogates to further obfuscate any leaked identifier. We evaluated the system with a publicly available dataset of 515 notes from the I2B2 2014 de-identification challenge and a dataset of 10,000 notes from the Mayo Clinic. In comparison with other existing tools considered best-in-class, our approach outperforms them with a recall of 0.992 and 0.994 and a precision of 0.979 and 0.967 on the I2B2 and the Mayo Clinic data, respectively. The automated de-identification system presented here can enable the generation of de-identified patient data at the scale required for modern machine learning applications to help accelerate medical discoveries."
Female-male differences in COVID vaccine adverse events have precedence in seasonal flu shots: a potential link to sex-associated baseline gene expression patterns,"Nearly   150   million   doses   of   FDA-authorized   COVID   vaccines   have   been administered in the United States. Sex-based differences of adverse events remain poorly understood,  mandating  the  need  for  real-world  investigation  from  Electronic  Health Records (EHRs) and broader epidemiological data sets. Based on an augmented curation of EHR clinical notes of 31,064 COVID-vaccinated individuals (19,321 females and 11,743 males) in the Mayo Clinic, we find that nausea and vomiting were documented significantly more frequently in females than males after both vaccine doses (nausea: RRDose 1= 1.67, pDose 1<0.001, RRDose 2= 2.2, pDose 1< 0.001; vomiting: RRDose 1= 1.58, pDose 1< 0.001, RRDose 2=  1.88,  pDose 1=  3.4x10-2).  Conversely,  fever,  fatigue,  and  lymphadenopathy  were  more common in males after the first dose vaccination (fever RR = 0.62; p = 8.65x10-3; fatigue RR = 0.86, p = 2.89x10-2; lymphadenopathy RR = 0.61, p = 3.45x10-3).Analysis of the Vaccine Adverse  Events  Reporting  System  (VAERS)  database  further  confirms  that  nausea comprises a larger fraction of total reports among females than males (RR: 1.58; p<0.001), while  fever  comprises  a  larger  fraction  of  total  reports  among  males  than  females  (RR: 0.84; p<0.001). Importantly, increased reporting of nausea and fever among females and males, respectively, is also observed for prior influenza vaccines in the VAERS database, establishing  that  these  differences  are  not  unique  to  the  recently  developed  COVID-19 vaccines.  Investigating  the  mechanistic  basis  underlying  these  clinical  findings,  an analysis  of  bulk  RNA-sequencing  data  from  12,158  human  blood  samples  (8626  female, 3532  male)  reveals  85  genes  that  are  not  only  significantly  different  in  their  gene expression between females and males at baseline, but also have established literature-based associations to COVID-19 as well as the vaccine-related adverse events ofclinical consequence. The NLRP3 inflammasome and the NR3C1 glucocorticoidreceptor emerge as  particularly  promising  baseline  links  to  sex-associated  vaccine  adverse  events, warranting targeted investigation of these signaling pathways and associated cell types. From a public health standpoint, our clinical findings shall aid in educating patients on the sex-associated risks they should expect for COVID-19 vaccinesand alsopromote better clinical management of vaccine-associated adverse events.IntroductionDifferent  types  of  COVID  vaccines  are  being  authorized  across  the  world  and  mass vaccination efforts are underway. Recently, we and others analyzed the safety1and effectiveness2of the Pfizer/BioNtech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines based on the analysis of patient records from large health systems. Although males and females were similarly represented in the safety cohorts of the COVID-19 vaccine trials, the safety and tolerability outcomes were only reported at the whole cohort level without a discussion of differences between sexes. Monitoring conducted as part of the U.S. vaccination program reported that the most reported adverse events involving persons not residing in long-term care facilities were women3. However, whether there are any differences in the adverse events between men and women remains unclear, warranting a real-world data-based analysis of the adverse event profiles.   .

3It is well-known that vaccination outcomes differ by sex which may be explained by various genetic, immunologic, and hormonal distinctions4. In a recent literature review adverse events to the influenza vaccine were reported to be higher in females over males5. The availability of vaccine associated adverse events from Mayo Clinic’s multi-state healthcare system provides an excellent opportunity to systematically investigate where there are any sex-specific differences in the  COVID  vaccine  associate  adverse  events.  We  have  previously  developed  augmented curation methods that facilitate rapid and real-time extraction of phenotypic data from the Mayo Clinic6. In addition, the vaccine adverse events reported in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is also a larger and diverse resource complimentary to the data present in patient records. Here, we leverage the augmented curation methods on Mayo Clinic patient records along with the analysis of the VAERS database to assess the sex-based differences in the COVID-19 vaccine associated adverse event profiles.MethodsStudy PopulationThe study involves assessment of two sets of data: (i) the individuals from Mayo Clinic Electronic Health Records (EHR) and (ii) the analysis of the adverse events reports submitted in the VAERS online database. For the dataset from Mayo ClinicHealth systems, we identified individuals who underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at the Mayo Clinic and hospitals affiliated with the Mayo Clinic Health System. This study was reviewed by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) anddetermined to be exempt from the requirement for IRB approval (45 CFR 46.104d, category 4). Subjects were excluded if they did not have a research authorization on file. The cohorts of vaccinated inclusion in this study are identical to the cohorts considered in our previous analysis on the safety7and effectiveness2of vaccines.  The following inclusion criteria were used in these studies: (1) atleast 18 years old; (2) no positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before December 1, 2020; (3) resides in a locale (based on Zip code) with at least 25 individuals who have received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. This data set did not include Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson and Johnson vaccine). Individuals with zero follow-up days after vaccination (i.e. those who received the first vaccine dose on the date of data collection) were also excluded, leaving 31,064 individuals in the final vaccinated cohort. Overall, we mainly assessed acohort of 31,064 individuals who were administered with a COVID-19 vaccine at the Mayo Clinic Health system between the time period December 15, 2020 and February 8, 2021.  31,064 individuals (19,321 females, 11,743 males) had received the first dose of the vaccine and 17,063 individuals had received the second dose of the vaccine. Definition of adverse effects of interestWe followed the adverse effects described in our prior study7, which were primarily derived from those assessed in Phase III trials of BNT162b2 and mRNA-12738,9, including fatigue, fever, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, lymphadenopathy, erythema, diarrhea, vomiting, and local pain and swelling. Anaphylaxis and facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy) were also included as these rare events have been reported in individuals receiving COVID-19 vaccines as well10,11.We mapped  .

4each adverse effect to a set of synonyms intended to capture the most common ways that a given phenotype would be referenced in the context of a clinical note. Curation of adverse effects from clinical notesTo curate the adverse effects experienced by each patient from the electronic health record,  we  used  a  Bidirectional  Encoder  Representations  from  Transformers(BERT)-based neural network model12to classify the sentiment for the phenotypes (described above) mentioned in  the  clinical  notes.  Specifically,  this  classification  model  categorizes  phenotype-containing sentences  into  one  of  four  categories:  (1)  confirmed  diagnosis,  (2)  ruled-out  diagnosis,  (3) possibility of disease, and (4) alternate context (e.g. family history). This classification model was trained on 18,500 sentences and has shown an out-of-sample accuracy of 93.6% with precision and recall scores above 95%6. For each individual, we applied the sentiment model to the clinical notes in the Mayo Clinic electronic health record during our defined intervals of interest: (1) Day V1to 21 days after Day V1, and (3) Day V2to 21 days after Day V2. For each phenotype, we identified the first date on which the given individual had at least one sentence in which the phenotype was categorized as “confirmed diagnosis” with a confidence score of at least 90%. For the severe phenotype anaphylaxis, each such sentence was manually reviewed to verify the positive sentiment (i.e. confirmed diagnosis) and to assess the tense of this sentiment (i.e. past vs. present). Only sentences which confirm a present diagnosis were used to count anaphylaxis events in this study.Curation of adverse effects from VAERS databaseWe obtained the adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccine for all three approved vaccines  in  the  US  (Pfizer/BioNtech -BNT162b2,  Moderna -mRNA-1273  and  Janssen -Ad26.CoV2.S) from the VAERS database. Our inclusion criteria for considering an adverse event for analysis was i) the onset of symptom date for the adverse event should be between December 15th 2020 to March 12th 2021. We removed (i) mislabeled adverse events where symptoms occurred earlier than December 15, 2020, ii) reports which were filed without a specified vaccine manufacturer,  iii)  adverse  events  whose  date  of  onset  of  symptom  was  before  the  date  of vaccination iv) adverse events which were filed without a specified gender, and v) adverse events which  were  obviously  not  untoward/abnormal.  The  frequencies  of  the  adverse  events  were computed at the level of unique VAERS id. We considered all the adverse events which fit under these criteria but we restricted our focus only to the adverse events phenotype described above. For the comparator, we also obtained the adverse events for influenza (seasonal) flu vaccine. The following Flu vaccine types were considered: 'FLUR3', 'FLUN3', 'FLU4', 'FLUA3', 'H5N1','FLU3', 'FLUC4', 'FLUX', 'FLUR4', 'FLUN4', 'FLUC3'. We assessed the data separately for 2019 (January 1st 2019 to December 31st 2019), 2020 (January 1st 2020 to January 31th 2020). We applied the inclusion criteria iii, iv and v described above for COVID-19 vaccine to the flu vaccines and filtered out the adverse events. The rest of the analysis for the Flu vaccine are the same as that of COVID-19 vaccine. We stratified the adverse events profiles based on gender and age (<55 years and ≥ 55 years). .

6Comparison of expression levels of all genes at baseline in blood samples of males and femalesGene expression data was processed from raw sequencing files obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)13. Briefly, our pipelines consisted of pre-processing FASTQ files with fastp14and gene expression quantification using GRCh38 human genome as reference with salmon15. For quantification we utilized Transcripts per Million (TPM) as the gene expression values. Metadata was scraped from the GEO database and entity type was extracted from the textual characteristics field using an internal Named Entity Recognition service. This provided labels  for  both  Blood-related  and  sex-related  categories.  All  downstream  analyses  were performed in R. Significance for gene expression difference were calculated using Welch’s t-test, and p-values were corrected using the Bonferroni method. Literature-based associations were calculated  using conditional  probabilities  of  co-occurrence  in  the  biomedical  literature  (incl. PubMed abstracts, PMC full articles, pre-prints, grants, patents and media articles), and have been described in detail elsewhere16. ResultsTo identify COVID-19 vaccine associated adverse events which may be disproportionately experienced between males and females, we performed augmented curation of EHR notes from 19321 females and 11743 males who received at least one doseof either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 at the Mayo clinic. Of these, 1735 females and 1052 males reported at least one adverse event within 21 days following the first vaccine dose. Among 11483 females and 5580 males who received two doses of either vaccine, 727females and 294 males reported at least one event within  21  days  after  the  second  dose.  Nausea  and  vomiting  were  more  documented  more frequently in females than males after both doses (nausea: RRDose 1= 1.67, pDose 1= 2.90x10-9, RRDose 2= 2.2, pDose 1= 2.68x10-6; vomiting: RRDose 1= 1.58, pDose 1= 7.95x10-4, RRDose 2= 1.88, pDose 1= 0.034; Table 1), while fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy were more common in males (fever RR = 0.62; p = 8.65x10-3; fatigue RR = 0.86, p = 2.89x10-2;lymphadenopathy RR = 0.61, p = 3.45x10-3; Table 1). Other adverse events were experienced at similar rates among females and males, including arthralgia, myalgia, and headache (Table 1).One limitation of studying vaccine associated adverse events through EHR curation is that it will only capture events in individuals who experience side effects serious enough to warrant clinical attention or who happen to have a routine clinical visit shortly after their vaccination. Alternatively, any vaccinated individual can report their experience of adverse events through the FDA Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), even outside of the clinical care context. To triangulate our observations from the Mayo Clinic system, we thus analyzed the 34,666 COVID-19 vaccine associated adverse event reports (26,249 females and 8,417 males) in the VAERS database. Since the data we analyzed from VAERS is based on reports that had any adverse event, we compared the adverse events in females and males from Mayo Clinic as a proportion of vaccinated females and males that reported any adverse event (conditional RR; cRR). Consistent with our EHR-based analysis, reports of nausea and vomiting comprised a larger fraction of reports from females than males (nausea cRR: 1.58, p<0.001; vomiting cRR: 1.19, p = 0.002; Table  1). Conversely, reports of fever/pyrexia comprised a larger fraction of  .

7reports from males than females (cRR = 0.84; p<0.001). Several other adverseevents were disproportionately reported in females (e.g. erythema, pain, diarrhea, headache, anaphylaxis) or males (e.g. facial paralysis, myalgia) in VAERS but not per EHR curation. These discrepancies may be due to differences in the underlying populations and sources of bias in the reporting and recording of adverse events through these systems.To understand whether the predisposition of females to experience nausea and vomiting, or predisposition of males to experience fever, after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine should be viewed as surprising or concerning, we performed a similar analysis of VAERS reports associated with the influenza vaccine in 2019 and 2020. Interestingly, nausea comprised a higher fraction of these reports among females than males in both years, and fever comprised a higher fraction of these reports among males in 2019. Several other effects which were more prevalent among COVID-19 vaccine associated reports from females (e.g. erythema, local pain, diarrhea, and headache) were also disproportionately reported among females after receiving the flu vaccine in 2020 and/or 2019.Taken together, this triangulation effort highlights that while there are indeed likely sex-based  differences  in  the  adverse  event  profiles  associated  with  COVID-19  vaccination. Specifically, our analyses of a single EHR and a national surveillance database highlight nausea and fever as side effects that disproportionately affect females and males, respectively. It is important to note, however, that these differences mirror prior experience with flu vaccines and thus should not be portrayed as phenomena which are specific to or particularly concerning for the recently developed COVID-19 vaccines.Finally, in order to identify potential mechanisms behind sex-associated sensitivity to the COVID vaccines we compared the expression levels of all genes in blood samples of males and females. This data was assembled from a host of studies taken from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) where the sample source was described asblood, and it includes 3,532 male blood samples and 8,626 female blood samples. By comparing these cohorts,we identified 8,257 genes out of ~60,000 gene-entities from Ensembl that were significantly different (Bonferroni adjusted  p-value  <  0.05  and  log2  Fold  Change  >  0.5)  between  males  and  females (Supplementary  Figure  1). We next obtained the amount of literature associated with these differential genes to COVID19 and the adverse events that have been reported for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Out of these, 85 genes also had a significant literature-based association to COVID19 and the vaccine related adverse events. Several of these genes stand out as potential mechanisms for sex-specific sensitivity to the vaccine. Interestingly, we found the inflammasome (through NLRP3 expression) to be higher in males compared to females and in the top differential genes (Supplementary Figure 2) and has a strong association with ‘fever’ in literature. This is concordant with the observation from the analysis of adverse eventsfrom Mayo Clinic data and VAERS, motivating the need to explore whether inflammasome could have a sex-specific role in the adverse events. In the hormone receptor family, we identified the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 as being highly expressed in femalesover males and also having a strong literature association with COVID19 (Supplementary Figure 3), fatigue, nausea and vomiting. This gene has been previously implicated in COVID19 severity17and couldbe linked to the increased nausea and vomiting to the vaccine in females. .

8DiscussionOur findings in the current study demonstrate higher reported nausea and vomiting in women, and higher reported fever in men who experience adverse events (AE) relatedto the COVID-19 vaccine across all datasets assessed. We additionally find that erythema, local pain and swelling, headache, diarrhea, and anaphylaxis have an increased prevalence in females with AEs and facial paralysis and myalgia are increased in men with AEs in the VAERS database. It should be noted that our findings do not demonstrate that women are more likely to experience any adverse events, as we did not assess the entire population who received the COVID vaccine. Rather, our findings suggest thatthere is a wider range of AEs that women are more likely to experience than men, if they experience any at all. While these findings are important for public health messaging, it is also important to note that they are similar to findings seen before withthe influenza vaccine, and therefore should not cause reason for vaccine fear or skepticism. There are several potential explanations for the differences in the adverse event profiles of females and males. A recent review of vaccine-induced hormonal immunity suggests that women  experience  enhanced  immune  reactogenicity,  leading  them  to  be  more  immune  to infectious diseases, but also resulting in a higher rate of adverse events18. These sex-based differences  could  be  do  to  hormonal,  genetic,  and  microbiota  responses,  with  a  particular emphasis on the role of sex hormones and immune response to vaccines. Indeed, interactions between  estrogen  and  flu  vaccines  have  been  hypothesized  to  boost  immunity  in  other studies19,20, and increased levels of estrogen are linked to both nausea and vomiting21, the two most salient adverse events that we see in the female population.In  addition  to  biological  reasons  for  sex-based  differences  in  AE  profiles,  there  are explanations for these differences that are related differences between men and women in the way that they perceive pain and how they interact with the healthcare system22. There is a growing body of literature to suggest that men and women experience pain and noxious stimuli differently, with women showing a greater sensitivity to pain.23–25This is in line with our findings, where the more  female-dominant  AEs  are  those  related  to  pain  (headache,  local  soreness,  and  even nausea) and the more male-dominant AEs are not associated with pain. A more behavioral explanation for our findings relates to sex-based differences in utilization of the healthcare system. It is well-known that men and women are treated differently by the healthcare system, and this in turn leads to sex-based differences in overall utilization. Women tend to use outpatient care and self-report lower health statuses than men2627, and while men tend to suffer more from severe and chronic conditions, they are much less likely to seek treatment for or report acute symptoms28. Our findings are likely due to acombination of all of these factors.There could be potential confounders for the sex-associated adverse events observed in this  study.  These  include  pre-existing  conditions,  prior  history  of  COVID,  demographic characteristics  such  race/ethnicity  and  vaccination  history  of  other  vaccines.  Future  studies accounting for these demographic variables and patient history would help delineate the sex-associated differences in adverse events. The dataset from Mayo Clinic was limited to individuals who had undergone PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, and this could introduce potential confounders related to the reason for testing, such as an illness, planned procedure, or travel. .

9Overall, though there are differences in the COVID vaccine associated adverse event profiles between females and males, such differences have been seen in Flu vaccines previously. Our findings will help in educating the patients and healthcare practitionerson the expected sex-specific risks to COVID vaccines as well as managing these adverse events prophylactically or therapeutically. With the roll-out of new COVID vaccines and the observation of sex-associatedside effects such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) seen in some younger women after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine29, there is a need to monitor the adverse events for all the COVID vaccines in near real-time in order to guide public health policies. Finally, the findings here motivate the need for clinical studies on causality and the biological mechanisms underlying the differences in the sex-associated adverse event profilesfor COVID-19 vaccines","Numerous approaches to de-identification have been developed. Automated de-identificationsystems can broadly be segmented into four categories: (i) rule-based systems, (ii) traditionalmachine learning systems, (iii) deep learning systems and (iv) hybrid and ensemble systems.Rule-based systems​19,20,30–32​ use pattern matching rules, regular expressions, dictionary andpublic database lookups to identify PII elements. These are simple to implement and usuallydeterministic; however, these systems have several drawbacks. First, pattern matching rules foridentifiers are typically not robust for handling variance in input due to typographicalerrors(spelling, punctuation, casing etc.); A rule that matches ​“Dr. John”​ may not be able tomatch ​“Dr john”​. Second, creating template patterns to match sentence fragments like ​“ProviderName: Dr. John”​ that tag any term after ​“Provider Name: Dr.”​ as a name, for example, requiresmanual effort to understand the data to create these templates. Doing this for large data setswith notes for millions of patients is time consuming and intractable. Third, dictionary-based14All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

systems may not be complete, resulting in increased ‘false negatives’ (i.e. true PII that is notdetected). Fourth, blindly using dictionary/database lookups induces ‘false positives’ becausethey tag phrases that are not identifiers in the context in which they are used that need to bedisambiguated​33​. For example, in ​“The doctor determined his Braden Score as normal”​, the term“Braden” might be flagged as PII, when it is only a clinical term​.Traditional Machine Learning (ML) systems​21,34–36​use traditional machine learning (ML)algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs), toperform NER classification as PII for each word in a sentence. The classification task involvescreating labeled data and defining features based on properties like part of speech (POS) tags,typography (e.g., capitalization, casing, spacing, font weights, or font types), punctuation, andfrequency of words and/or their neighbors. These methods, in addition to requiring significanteffort in encoding the feature vectors, may not generalize across datasets.Deep Learning systems​18​, ​have become the state-of-the-art for a wide variety of applicationdomains, including vision (e.g., image classification) and speech (e.g., voice recognition andgeneration). In language-related tasks (e.g machine translation), these approaches havesurpassed human level performance​37​. Deep learning has proven beneficial in numerous NLPtasks, including predicting the next word (language modeling), tagging tasks such as part ofspeech tags, entities in a sentence (entity recognition), and dependency parsing. This hasenabled applications that traditionally required custom rules and hand-crafted features to besolved without any feature engineering. ​Modern deep learning approaches for de-identificationhave been shown to outperform their predecessors​18​, but they require very large quantities ofdomain specific labeled training data to perform well. Specifically, the challenges include, butare not limited to, the presence of long and highly descriptive sentences, usage of clinicalshorthand (that vary across physicians and medical specialties), and a variety of semi-structuredmachine generated content. Moreover, publicly available datasets for de-identification (includingthe popular i2b2 2014 dataset​17​) lack diversity, often focusing on only a few types of notes orareas of disease. Training and benchmarking with such datasets is likely to bias the resultingmodels and fail to capture the nuanced and complex nature of physician notes. Recently,attention-based neural network (transformer) models have also been implemented forde-identification but have shown limited generalizability in the absence of support from encodedrules​38​.Hybrid​39​ and Ensemble Systems​40,41​ use combinations of rule-based and machinelearning-based components in tandem to improve PII detection efficacy. With these approaches,the choice of components, finding the right split of tasks between them and the optimal strategyfor combining results from them become crucial. Some approaches​42​ invoke engineeringpost-processing layers that fix the errors that are introduced by other (earlier) components. Incases where there is, by design, overlap in the type of PII being predicted (e.g. multiplecomponents detecting people names), considerable effort is spent measuring and choosing amethod, like a stacked meta classifier or voting scheme, to pick a winning component​40​. Thenference de-identification system presented here addresses the limitations of prior methods​11and achieves high levels of recall and precision.There are several opportunities to further improve the performance of de-identification systems.First, existing knowledge graphs and language models trained on biomedical corpora can beleveraged. For example, if a patient’s note contains the sentences “​Patient diagnosed with lungcancer” and “ECOG performance status was determined to be 2​”, ECOG would not be treatedas PII since it has a strong biological association with lung cancer based on the knowledge15All rights reserved.

graph. In the de-identification process, this could be used to recover biological terms incorrectlytagged as PII (false positives). Second, the quality of sentences that are provided to the modelcan be improved. Unstructured clinical text does not always contain well-formatted textcommonly due to missing punctuations and incorrect casing. A case-sensitive pre-trained modelalong with a masked-language model objective can be used to train a system capable ofcorrectly introducing punctuation in the right location. Another challenge with the quality ofclinical documents is the prevalence of short fragments and bullet points giving rise tosentences with poor context. Context of a single sentence can be expanded using precedingand succeeding sentences or employing document level transformer models such asTransformer-XL​43​. Third, unsupervised methods can be incorporated to accelerate theannotation process of the NER task. Grouping the word representations generated by atransformer model yields informative clusters (e.g. a cluster of names) that can be annotatedaccording to the nature of words present in the cluster. The NER task can then be formulated asa mask language task, where the overlap of the list of potential candidates for a missing wordwith the clusters can inform the entity type of the missing word.","Our findings in the current study demonstrate higher reported nausea and vomiting in women, and higher reported fever in men who experience adverse events (AE) relatedto the COVID-19 vaccine across all datasets assessed. We additionally find that erythema, local pain and swelling, headache, diarrhea, and anaphylaxis have an increased prevalence in females with AEs and facial paralysis and myalgia are increased in men with AEs in the VAERS database. It should be noted that our findings do not demonstrate that women are more likely to experience any adverse events, as we did not assess the entire population who received the COVID vaccine. Rather, our findings suggest thatthere is a wider range of AEs that women are more likely to experience than men, if they experience any at all. While these findings are important for public health messaging, it is also important to note that they are similar to findings seen before withthe influenza vaccine, and therefore should not cause reason for vaccine fear or skepticism. There are several potential explanations for the differences in the adverse event profiles of females and males. A recent review of vaccine-induced hormonal immunity suggests that women  experience  enhanced  immune  reactogenicity,  leading  them  to  be  more  immune  to infectious diseases, but also resulting in a higher rate of adverse events18. These sex-based differences  could  be  do  to  hormonal,  genetic,  and  microbiota  responses,  with  a  particular emphasis on the role of sex hormones and immune response to vaccines. Indeed, interactions between  estrogen  and  flu  vaccines  have  been  hypothesized  to  boost  immunity  in  other studies19,20, and increased levels of estrogen are linked to both nausea and vomiting21, the two most salient adverse events that we see in the female population.In  addition  to  biological  reasons  for  sex-based  differences  in  AE  profiles,  there  are explanations for these differences that are related differences between men and women in the way that they perceive pain and how they interact with the healthcare system22. There is a growing body of literature to suggest that men and women experience pain and noxious stimuli differently, with women showing a greater sensitivity to pain.23–25This is in line with our findings, where the more  female-dominant  AEs  are  those  related  to  pain  (headache,  local  soreness,  and  even nausea) and the more male-dominant AEs are not associated with pain. A more behavioral explanation for our findings relates to sex-based differences in utilization of the healthcare system. It is well-known that men and women are treated differently by the healthcare system, and this in turn leads to sex-based differences in overall utilization. Women tend to use outpatient care and self-report lower health statuses than men2627, and while men tend to suffer more from severe and chronic conditions, they are much less likely to seek treatment for or report acute symptoms28. Our findings are likely due to acombination of all of these factors.There could be potential confounders for the sex-associated adverse events observed in this  study.  These  include  pre-existing  conditions,  prior  history  of  COVID,  demographic characteristics  such  race/ethnicity  and  vaccination  history  of  other  vaccines.  Future  studies accounting for these demographic variables and patient history would help delineate the sex-associated differences in adverse events. The dataset from Mayo Clinic was limited to individuals who had undergone PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, and this could introduce potential confounders related to the reason for testing, such as an illness, planned procedure, or travel. .

9Overall, though there are differences in the COVID vaccine associated adverse event profiles between females and males, such differences have been seen in Flu vaccines previously. Our findings will help in educating the patients and healthcare practitionerson the expected sex-specific risks to COVID vaccines as well as managing these adverse events prophylactically or therapeutically. With the roll-out of new COVID vaccines and the observation of sex-associatedside effects such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) seen in some younger women after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine29, there is a need to monitor the adverse events for all the COVID vaccines in near real-time in order to guide public health policies. Finally, the findings here motivate the need for clinical studies on causality and the biological mechanisms underlying the differences in the sex-associated adverse event profilesfor COVID-19 vaccines."
Hair loss in females and thromboembolism in males are significantly enriched in post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) relative to recent medical history,"After one year of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 130 million individuals worldwidehave been infected with the novel coronavirus, yet the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19(PASC), also referred to as the ‘long COVID’ syndrome, remains mostly uncharacterized.We leveraged machine-augmented curation of the physician notes from electronic healthrecords (EHRs) across the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system to retrospectivelycontrast the occurrence of symptoms and diseases in COVID-19 patients in thepost-COVID period relative to the pre-COVID period (n=6,413). Through comparison ofthe frequency of 10,039 signs and symptoms before and after diagnosis, we identified anincrease in hypertensive chronic kidney disease (OR 47.3, 95% CI 23.9-93.6, p=3.50x10-9),thromboembolism (OR 3.84, 95% CI 3.22-4.57, p=1.18x10-4), and hair loss (OR 2.44, 95% CI2.15-2.76, p=8.46x10-3) in COVID-19 patients three to six months after diagnosis.  Thesequelae associated with long COVID were notably different among male vs femalepatients and patients above vs under 55 years old, with the hair loss enrichment foundprimarily in females and the thromboembolism enrichment in males.  These findingscompel targeted investigations into what may be persistent dermatologic, cardiovascular,and coagulopathic phenotypes following SARS-CoV-2 infection.IntroductionSince its emergence in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its clinical syndrome coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have elicitedclinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic disease to severe respiratory failure anddeath,  as  well  as  a  number  of  extra-pulmonary  manifestations.  Despite  extensivecharacterization of its acute presentation, relatively little is known about the long-term effects ofboth mild and severe COVID-191,2. Telephone interviews of outpatient SARS-CoV-2 infectedpatients 14-21 days after positive RT-PCR test identified persistence of fatigue, cough, dyspnea,and headache most commonly3.

symptom onset found that 87.4% still had at least one symptom, most commonly fatigue ordyspnea4. Another study of 55 recovered COVID-19 patients 3 months after discharge found71% had radiologic abnormalities and 25% had abnormal pulmonary function tests5.A better understanding of the convalescent phase and long-term consequences ofCOVID-19 (“long COVID”) is crucial as the number of patients who have been infected withSARS-CoV-2 and recover from COVID-19 continues to rise. Several efforts are ongoing tomonitor self-reported symptoms following COVID-19 recovery6, but results from these studieswill be limited by the pace at which patients are recruited. Current attempts to assess thelong-term sequelae of COVID-19 using structured data such as International Classification ofDisease (ICD) codes are limited by a finite set of possible variables and are biased bya prioriselection of variables of interest.We have previously reported using an augmented curation approach, whereinBERT-based neural networks are used to identify diseases and symptoms that have beenpositively attributed to patients in unstructured clinical documentation to curate millions of notesin a short period of time7. Here we leverage augmented curation to retrospectively curate thecomplete electronic health records (EHRs) of COVID-19 patients in order to identify symptomsand phenotypes that persist several months after diagnosis of the viral infection.ResultsTo identify signs and symptoms associated with long COVID, we performed augmentedcuration from clinical notes of COVID-19 patients 1-6 months before and 3-6 months afterdiagnosis. Using deep neural networks over an institution-wide platform, we extracted positivelyattributed signs, symptoms, and diseases from Mayo Clinic electronic health records (EHRs).Among 10,039 signs and symptoms identified from the EHRs of 6,413 COVID-19 patients(Table 1), we identified seven terms significantly increased after diagnosis relative to beforediagnosis: infection (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.67-1.78, p=1.31x10-29), pneumonia (OR 1.91, 95% CI1.81-2.01, p=1.15x10-14), hypertensive chronic kidney disease (OR 47.3, 95% CI 23.9-93.6,p=3.50x10-9),  thromboembolism  (OR  3.84,  95%  CI  3.22-4.57,  p=1.18x10-4),  venousthromboembolism (OR 5.91, 95% CI 3.22-3.84, p=1.84x10-4), and hair loss (OR 2.44, 95% CI2.15-2.76, p=8.45x10-3), and immunodeficiency (OR 4.13, 95% CI 3.31-5.16, p=1.95x10-2)(Figure 1, Supplementary Table 1).  In contrast, 183 terms were more prevalent beforediagnosis, most significantly pain (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.63-0.66, p=5.14x10-39), hypertension (OR0.67, 95% CI 0.65-0.68, p=1.26x10-36), and swelling (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.56-0.60, p=8.75x10-28).These findings suggest that hypertensive chronic kidney disease, coagulopathies, and hair lossmight be associated with long COVID.Demographic and clinical stratification of patients revealed distinct signs and symptomsassociated with long COVID (Table 2). For female patients (n=3,870), only infection and hairloss were significantly enriched after COVID-19 diagnosis, while infection, pneumonia, andthromboembolism were specifically enriched among male patients in the post-COVID period(Figure 2). For patients under 55 years old (n=3,464), only infection was significantly enrichedafter COVID-19 diagnosis (Figure 3). Among hospitalized (n=703) and ICU-admitted (n=209)2 .

patients, pneumonia and respiratory failure were documented more frequently in clinical notes3-6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis than in the 1-6 months before (Figure 4).Although we focused on notes in the 3-6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis, it isimportant to realize that the documentation of a phenotype in this time interval does notnecessarily imply that it actually occurred during this interval. For example, the enrichment ofinfection and pneumonia in the post-COVID period likely reflects a discussion of the priorCOVID-19 infection rather than the development of a new infection. To distinguish such signalsthat may reflect phenotypes which occurred in the peri-COVID window from those that trulyemerge in the post-COVID period, we examined the cumulative incidence of each phenotypefound to be enriched in the post-COVID period as a function of time relative to COVID diagnosis(Figure 5). Indeed, we observe a distinct acceleration in occurrences of “hair loss” amongfemales and “thromboembolism”/”venous thromboembolism” among males in the post-COVIDperiod, whereas this was not observed for “pneumonia”, “hypertensive chronic kidney disease”,and  “respiratory  failure”.  Taken  together,  these  data  suggest  that  hair  loss  andthromboembolism warrant further study as potentially unique features of long COVID in femalesand males, respectively.DiscussionThrough augmented curation analysis of over sixty thousand COVID-19 patient charts,we have identified a range of phenotypes, including type 2 diabetes, thromboembolism, and hairloss, as possible long-term associations with COVID-19 diagnosis. By comparing COVID-19patients before and after diagnosis, we have unbiasedly characterized signs and symptomsboth due to disease onset, and signs and symptoms specific to a given respiratory infection.Early investigations of long COVID have provided helpful preliminary characterization ofthe sequelae of signs and symptoms that arise months after COVID-19 diagnosis. Among signsand symptoms reported in the months after COVID-19 diagnosis, the most commonassociations with long COVID include fatigue, cough, myalgia, headache, memory problems,and anosmia. Notably, these analyses have relied on structured patient data or self-reportedsymptoms, and are therefore limited to a finite set of biased variables. The present analysis ofphysician-documented diseases, signs, and symptoms in unstructured EHR data provides anunbiased approach to identify signs and symptoms associated with long COVID. Reassuringly,our findings corroborate early studies of the signs and symptoms of long COVID, includingheadache and hair loss, emphasizing the importance of monitoring for these in the months afterCOVID-19 diagnosis.  We also report several new associations with long COVID, includinghypertensive chronic kidney disease and thromboembolism, which may warrant furtherinvestigation and validation using structured patient data. Overall, these differences betweenour analysis using augmented curation and previous analyses of long COVID highlight the needfor a deeper understanding of the differences between information captured in unstructuredcompared to structured health data.The approach to automatically curating physician notes taken here has limitations. First,we curate whether or not a physician is ascribing a diagnosis or symptom to a patientindependent of the acuity of the diagnosis. Documentation of a prior or historical illness is not3 .

differentiated from a newly documented illness. The within-patient comparison of post-COVIDsymptoms and diseases to pre-COVID symptoms and diseases mitigates this effect, but it isimportant to note that the pre-COVID period covers only the 1-6 months prior to COVID-19diagnosis. Furthermore, though the inclusion criteria for the study require at least one symptomor disease documented in both the pre-COVID and post-COVID period, the type of clinicaldocument(s) that this symptom or disease may be identified in is left unrestricted. Thus,comprehensive patient medical histories may not be captured in the pre-COVID period.As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there is mounting concern over its long-termconsequences.  Although our understanding of the acute manifestations of COVID-19 hasimproved, disease presentation and long-term effects remain relatively uncharacterized due tothe paucity of long-term patient data. Augmented curation allows us to begin to address thisshortcoming by unbiasedly extracting key word associations from tens of thousands of patientcharts.  Here we have identified a range of phenotypes, including thromboembolism andhypertensive chronic kidney disease, as possible long-term associations with COVID-19diagnosis. These findings compel targeted investigations into what may be persistentcoagulopathic phenotypes following SARS-CoV-2 infection.MethodsStudy designThis retrospective study was comprised of patients who presented to the Mayo ClinicHealth System (including tertiary medical centers in Minnesota, Arizona, and Florida) andreceived at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test since the start of the COVID-19 pandemicand further limited to those that have had at least one symptom or disease attributed to them inunstructured clinical documentation during the 1 to 5 months prior to COVID positive test and 3to 6 months post COVID positive test (n = 6,432). COVIDpospatients were identified via apositive PCR test result.Natural Language Processing / augmented curation of electronic health records (EHRs)We used previously developed and detailed state-of-the-art BERT-based neuralnetworks13to rapidly curate clinical notes that were authored within 6 months of and COVID-19diagnoses. Specifically, the model extracts sentences containing clinical phenotypes andsymptoms and classifies their sentiment into the following categories: Yes (confirmed clinicalmanifestation or diagnosis), No (ruled out clinical manifestation or diagnosis), Maybe (possibilityof clinical manifestation or diagnosis), and Other (alternate context, e.g., family history ofdisease). The neural networks are pre-trained on 3.17 billion tokens from the biomedical andcomputer science domains (SciBERT)14and subsequently trained using 18,490 sentences andapproximately 250 phenotypes with an emphasis on cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolicphenotypes. It achieves 93.6% overall accuracy and over 95% precision and recall for both“Yes” and “No” sentiment classification.4 .

Statistical analysesTo compute the statistical significance of enrichment of a specific condition following aCOVID-19 diagnosis, McNemar’s test was employed. This test is specifically designed formatched pairs with binary outcomes (here, the absence or presence of symptom or disease intime period of interest) and evaluates the null hypothesis that the probability of a specificcondition occurring following a COVID-19 diagnosis is equal to the probability of theaforementioned condition occurring before said diagnosis. In this analysis we used the exactversion of the McNemar test to compute the p-value for the null hypothesis. We computed theRisk Difference (the difference between the probability of a condition occurring following thediagnosis and the probability of the same condition occurring before the diagnosis), the RiskRatio (the ratio of the probability of a condition occurring following the diagnosis to theprobability of the same condition occurring before the diagnosis), and the Odds Ratio (the ratioof the odds of a condition occurring following the diagnosis to the odds of the same conditionoccurring before the diagnosis), as well as their respective 95% Wald Confidence Intervals. Allmultiple hypothesis tests were Bonferroni corrected.Institutional Review Board (IRB)This is a retrospective study of individuals who underwent polymerase chain reaction(PCR) testing for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Mayo Clinic and hospitals affiliatedwith the Mayo Clinic Health System. This study was reviewed by the Mayo Clinic InstitutionalReview Board (IRB) and determined to be exempt from the requirement for IRB approval (45CFR 46.104d, category 4). Subjects were excluded if they did not have a research authorizationon file.Patient and public involvementThe development of the research question and outcome measures was informed by priorliterature and information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on riskfactors for severe COVID-19 illness. No patients were involved in the design of the study, butphysicians from the Mayo Clinic who are involved with the COVID-19 research taskforce and theclinical care for COVID-19 patients were involved with the study design and execution.Data AvailabilityAfter publication, the data will be made available to others upon reasonable requests tothe corresponding author. A proposal with detailed description of study objectives and statisticalanalysis plan will be needed for evaluation of the reasonability of requests. Deidentified data willbe provided after approval from the corresponding author and the Mayo Clinic standard IRBprocess for such requests.","Through augmented curation analysis of over sixty thousand COVID-19 patient charts,we have identified a range of phenotypes, including type 2 diabetes, thromboembolism, and hairloss, as possible long-term associations with COVID-19 diagnosis.

Counties with lower insurance coverage are associated with both slower vaccine rollout and higher COVID-19 incidence across the United States,"Efficient and equitable vaccination distribution is a priority for effectively outcompeting the transmission  of  COVID-19  globally.  A  recent  study  from  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and Prevention (CDC) identified that US counties with high social vulnerability according to metrics such as poverty, unemployment, low income, and no high school diploma, have significantly lower rates  of  vaccination  compared  to  the  national  average1.  Here,  we  build  upon  this  analysis  to consider  associations  between  county-level  vaccination  rates  and  68  different  demographic, socioeconomic,  and  environmental  factors  for  1,510  American  counties  with  over  228  million individuals for which vaccination data was also available. Our analysis reveals that counties with high levels of uninsured individuals have significantly lower COVID-19 vaccination rates (Spearman correlation: -0.264), despite the fact that the CDC has mandated that all COVID-19 vaccines are free and cannot be denied to anyone based upon health insurance coverage or immigration status. Furthermore, we find that the counties with high levels of uninsured individuals tend to have the highest COVID-19 incidence rates in March 2021 relative to December 2020 (Spearman correlation: 0.388).  Among  the  68  factors  analyzed,  insurance  coverage  is  the  only  factor  which  is  highly correlated with both vaccination rate and change in COVID-19 incidence during the vaccination period (|Spearman correlation| > 0.25). We also find that counties with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic individuals have significantly lower vaccination rates (Spearman correlations: -0.128, -0.136) and lesser declines of COVID-incidence rates (Spearman correlations: 0.334, 0.330) during the vaccination period. Surprisingly however, after controlling for race, we find that the association between lack of insurance coverage and vaccination rate as well as COVID-19 incidence rates is largely  driven  by  counties  with  a  majority  white  population.  Among  the  counties  with  high proportions of white residents (top 10% decile), the association between insurance coverage and vaccination rate is significant (Spearman correlation: -0.210, p-value: 0.002), but among counties with  low  proportions  of  white  residents  (bottom  10%  decile)  this  association  is  not  significant (Spearman correlation: 0.072, p-value: 0.088). Taken together, this study highlights the fact that intricate socioeconomic factors are correlated not just to COVID-19 vaccination rates, but also to COVID-19  incidence  fluctuations,  underscoring  the  need  to  improve  COVID-19  vaccination campaigns  in  marginalized  communities.  The  strong  positive  correlation  between  low  levels  of health  insurance  coverage  and  low  vaccination  rates  is  particularly  concerning,  and  calls  for improved public health messaging to emphasize the fact that health insurance is not required to be eligible for any of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the United StatesIntroductionThe COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the United States has been among one of the fastest in the world2.  However, this rapid vaccine rollout has not benefited all Americans equally, and the vaccination rate in some marginalized communities has lagged significantly behind the average3.  It is well known that social determinants of health (SDoH) and aspects of an individual’s life that occur “outside of the four walls of  .

2healthcare”  have  tremendous  impact  on  actual  health  status4,5.  As  we  approach  the  status  of  ‘herd immunity’ with COVID-19 vaccinations, it is of critical importance that the US is not viewed as a monolith, and that the vaccination coverage to promote herd immunity is equally distributed across all communities. A recent study by the CDC showed that vaccine coverage is lower in counties with high social vulnerability based upon socioeconomic indicators (poverty, unemployment, low income, no high school diploma)1. This study did not, however, assess the interplay between these factors and new COVID-19 incidence rates. In addition, another recent analysis 580 US counties found that the change in COVID-19 incidence from December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021 is significantly correlated with cumulative vaccination rate through March 1, 20216. However, it remains unclear whether disparities in vaccine rollout and associated COVID-19 infection rate fluctuations have been driven by some specific socioeconomic and population health factors. Using publicly-available data, we assessed the relationship between a large set of socioeconomic variables, vaccine coverage, and COVID-19 incidence rates in 1,510 counties across the United States. We  demonstrate  that  variables  related  to  uninsurance  status  and  racial  minority  make-up  are  both negatively associated with vaccine coverage and new case incidence. By stratifying counties according to minority population percentage, however, we also find that the relationship between being uninsured and poor  vaccine  coverage  is  not  uniform  across  all  races,  and  that  this  relationship  is  much  stronger  in predominantly white counties. We additionally stratify counties by their vaccine coverage and determine the relative risk of different socioeconomic factors with high and low vaccination rates. Our findings show that the most significant risk factors for poor vaccination at the county-level are those related to poverty and environmental  safety  such  as  uninsurance  prevalence,  teen  births,  and  violent  crimes,  and  the  most significant protective factors are related to food security, social connectivity, and education level. Taken together, our findings suggest several calls to action that could be implemented to increase vaccine coverage across the United States. The first is compounded by the findings of others, and relates to the racial and disparities in vaccine coverage across the country. The second call to action, however, is novel and suggests that communication surrounding vaccination eligibility in the uninsured population, and particularly in the white uninsured population, may increase vaccination rates and decrease new case incidence.MethodsWe analyzed 1,510 counties in the United States which have cumulative vaccination data available through March 1, 2021.  These counties include over 228 million individuals from 21 states and the District of  Columbia,  including:  California,  Connecticut,  Florida,  Georgia,  Illinois,  Indiana,  Maine,  Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming. A map of states included in the analysis is provided in Supplementary Figure S1. For counties in these states, we obtained vaccination data from state government websites (county-level  vaccination  data  was  not  readily  available  for  the  other  states).    For  each  county,  the vaccination ratewas defined as the percentage of individuals in the county with at least one dose of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine as of March 1, 2021.  In addition, county-level COVID-19 incidence data wasobtained from the CDC COVID Data Tracker7.  The change in COVID-19 incidenceis defined as the 7-day rolling average COVID-19 incidence rate on March 1, 2021 minus the 7-day rolling average COVID-19 incidence rate on December 1, 2020, where the COVID-19 incidence rate is the number of new COVID-19 cases reported in the county per 10,000 individuals.Demographic and socioeconomic data for each county was obtained from the 2020 County Health Rankings8resource provided by the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps program at the University of Wisconsin  Population  Health  Institute.  We  applied  a  75%  completeness  requirement  to  each  of  our  .

3variables, leaving us with 68 out of a total of 131 variables from the 2020 County Health Rankings. We note that most of the variables with limited data availability were race-specific variables for minority populations (e.g. Number of firearm fatalities -Black, Motor vehicle crash deaths -Hispanic), so these could not be included in our analysis.  A complete list of demographic and socioeconomic variables with data available is included in Table 1. For each of the 68 county-level features, we compute the Spearman rank correlations between: (1) the feature of interest and county-level vaccination rateand (2) the feature of interest and county-level change in COVID-19 incidence. Spearman rank correlations and corresponding p-values were computed using the SciPy package9in Python.Next, we grouped each county into quartiles based on percent vaccinated through March 1, 2021. For a select number of county-level features, we computed the rates in the top and bottom quartiles, and reported the relative risks and Fisher exact test p-values.  For the relative risk values, 95% confidence intervals were computed using a delta-method approximation10. The results are presented in Table 2. Finally, to disentangle relationships between race, insurance status, and our outcome variables, we isolated the top and bottom deciles of counties as determined by the percentage of their populations that were white. Within these two deciles, we performed further correlation analyses with insurance status and vaccine coverage.ResultsResults from our correlation analyses are synthesized togetherin Figure 1.Each socioeconomic variable is plotted to show the strength of its relationship with county-level vaccine coverage (x-axis) and county-level  new  COVID-19  incidence  (y-axis).  The  upper  left  quadrant  contains  variables  that  are associated  with both  increased  incidence  and  poor  vaccine  coverage,  and  the  bottom  right  quadrant contains variables that are associated with decreased incidence and better vaccine coverage. Inter-variable correlations are shown in Supplementary Figure 2.Counties with high rates of uninsured individuals have lower vaccination rates and lower declines in COVID-19 incidenceA  county’s  percentage  of  uninsured  adults  and  unemployed  adults  were  both  significantly correlated with the percentage of the county that had been vaccinated (Spearman correlation: -0.264, p-value:  <1e-5;  Spearman  correlation: -0.208,  p-value:  <1e-5)  (see Table  1).  However,  the  relationship between these two factors and the incidence change in COVID-19 cases from December 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021 was vastly different. There was a significant positive correlation between the percent of the county who was uninsured and the case incidence change (Spearman correlation: 0.388, p-value: <1e-5), but no significant relationship was observed betweenunemployment level and new cases (Spearman correlation: 0.008, p-value: 0.20). Table  2demonstrates  that  the  relative  risk  related  to  the  percent  of  uninsured  adults  in  the population is 0.742, where counties in the top quartile of vaccine coverage have 9.9% uninsured adults and those in the bottom quartile have 13.4%. This translates to counties in the top quartile of vaccination coverage have a 25% lower uninsured population compared to those in the bottom quartile.Table 3looks at the top and bottom deciles of counties, ranked by percent of the county that is uninsured. On average, counties in the bottom decile have an uninsurance rate of 24.1%. We find that less-insured counties are more rural, have more minorities, and higher percentages of young people. The states contributing to these counties are Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Texas. The bottom 25 counties for “uninsured rate” are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. .

4The  relationship  between  race  and  insurance  status  is  varied  in  itscorrelation  with  vaccine coverage and new case incidenceAll racial minorities included in our analysis were correlated with higher incidence of new COVID-19 cases. With the exception of Asians, the prevalence of all other racial minority groups in counties was also negatively correlated with vaccine coverage. We compared the top 10% of counties based on the percentage of the population that was white to the bottom 10% of white counties, and performed correlation analyses in each between uninsurance status, vaccination coverage, and new case incidence. We found that in the top white counties, uninsurance status was significantly negatively correlated with vaccination coverage (Spearman correlation: -0.210, p-value: 0.002) and positively associated with newcase incidence (Spearman correlation: 0.349, p-value: <1e-5). Conversely, in the bottom white counties, uninsurance rate was not significantly associated with vaccination coverage (Spearman correlation: 0.072, p-value: 0.0875) and was negatively correlated with new case incidence (Spearman correlation: -0.132, p-value: 0.002) (Figure 2). The bottom white decile had a racial make-up of 31% white, 17% Black, 46% Hispanic, 4% Asian, and less than 1% Native American Indian. Environmental risk factors and education levels are differentially correlated with vaccination rates and COVID-19 incidenceAll education variables associated with higher levels of education (college or associate degree, bachelor’s degree or higher, and some college 2020) were positively correlated with vaccine coverage, and their correlations with new COVID-19 incidence rates were weak. The two variables associated with lower education levels, however (no HS diploma and HS diploma only) were both negatively correlated with vaccine coverage(Table 1).Our  analysis  highlights  two  key  factors  (annual  incidence  of  motor  vehicle  crash  deaths  and incidence  of  firearm  fatalities)  that  we  have  grouped  as  “environmental  risk  factors”  were  negatively correlated with vaccine coverage, and positively correlated with new COVID-19. case incidence. A related correlation of note is “access to exercise opportunities” which can be viewed as an environmental protective factor, and was positively correlated with vaccine coverage, but unrelated to new COVID-19 incidence rates.Relative  risks  are  shown  in Table  2for  other  environmental  protective  factors  such  as  social associations and food environment index, which translate to higher vaccination coverage counties having a 21% and an 18% increase in each factor, respectively. In particular, counties with relatively high social association ranking, as reflected by the number of their civic organizations, have significantly higher levels of vaccination and steeper declines in COVID-19 incidence rates (Table 1). DiscussionOur findings indicate that there are several groups of socioeconomic factors that are related to the percentage of a county that is vaccinated, as well as the incidence of new COVID-19 cases, but these relationships have different strengths and directionalities, highlighting the complexities of socioeconomic disparities  in  the  United  States  and  the  vastness  of  their  impacts.  The  most  striking  finding  from  our analyses was the strong relationship with health insurance status and both vaccination coverage as well as new  COVID-19  incidence  rates.  Going  further,  we  found  that  these  relationships  were  strongest  in predominantly white counties, indicating a specific relationship between being white and uninsured and poor  vaccination  coverage.  We  hypothesize  that  this  relationship  may  be  due  to  widespread misunderstanding about individuals’ eligibility and financial responsibility for the COVID-19 vaccine, and  .

5suggest that better nationwide communication about the role of health insurance in vaccine eligibility may help vaccinate more individuals to bring us closer to herd immunity.Despite the US government’s financial sponsorship of the COVID-19 vaccine11, we see a strong relationship between county-level health insurance status, percent of the county that has been vaccinated, and the incidence of new cases since the beginning of 2021. In fact, the percent of individuals uninsured in a county was the only variable whose Spearman coefficient exceeded 0.25 for both vaccine coverage and new  case  incidence.  Juxtaposed  with  the  relationships  seen  with  unemployment,  which  was  only significantly correlated with vaccination coverage but not with new COVID-19 incidence, this is an important insight. The relationship between unemployment and vaccine coverage was recently analyzed by the CDC, but not its association with new incidence rates, which we find here to be insignificant. One hypothesis to explain these differing relationships with uninsured status and unemployment is in community education about COVID-19 and vaccine eligibility. Many individuals receive information about general health and also about their vaccine eligibility status from their primary care provider12. This relationship does not exist in the case  of  individuals  without  health  insurance,  and  so  individuals  without  health  insurance  may  be significantly uninformed about basic COVID-19 precautions that could prevent new incidences, and alsoabout their eligibility for the vaccine. Direct messaging from the government to inform individuals that they are eligible for the vaccine regardless of insurance status may have a significant impact on both vaccine coverage and new case incidence rates.In this study we also highlight the significant racial disparities that exist in the US in the context of COVID-19, which have been covered by numerous other studies13–15. Many of these studies have shown that overall outcomes of COVID-19 are poorer in communities with large populations of racial minorities. In the same vein, we demonstrate that counties with higher percentages of racial minorities are showing higher incidence rates in the first several months of 2021. While still significant, the relationship between racial minority make-up and lower vaccine coverage is weaker. These findings suggest that communities with larger populations of racial minorities are still suffering from the pandemic two-fold: the vaccine is not as readily available to them, and to those who the vaccine has not yet been administered, social precautions to  prevent  the  spread  of  COVID-19  are  not  being  as  widely  implemented.  Interestingly,  the  impact  of uninsurance status in minority communities is not related to vaccine coverage, and this relationship appears to be most present in predominantly white communities. We do see relationships between uninsurance and new case incidence in both predominantly white and non-white counties, although the relationships are opposing in directionality. It is difficult to draw conclusions about the cause of new cases, as the virus’ timeline varies widely across different regions of the country, but we hypothesize that it could be due to uninsured white individuals living in more rural areas with less virus spread, versus uninsured minorities living in more densely populated areas (Supplementary Figure S4). As stated in our Methods section, only 68 of the original 131 variables were able to be utilized due to limitations with data availability. We note that many variables that were lacking in complete data were those at the intersection of racial minority status and other socioeconomic factors, such as homicide rates within  specific  racial  segments.  Specifically,  52  of  the  63  incomplete  variables  were  specific  to  racial minority groups, and all data variables with less than 35% completeness were specific to racial minority groups. Had this been available, we may have been able to parseout more specific relationships of COVID-19, vaccination coverage, and racial minorities. We also note that one of the challenges in assessing both vaccine coverage as well as new incidence rates is in the diversity of state roll-out plans, in terms of timeline and eligibility criteria. A future retrospective analysis comparing individual states is an important next step to be taken when more data has been collected across the nation.It is well-established that factors pertaining to race, wealth, housing and education status are tightly intertwined when it comes to healthcare16,17. To this end, it is not surprising that we see similar trends with lower education, poorer housing status, income inequality, and racial minorities that move in the same  .

6direction in our analyses. All of these factors show some relationship with poorer vaccine coverage, and higher recent incidence rates. We highlight in our results that there are also environmental risk factors that fall into the same pattern. In general, our findings show that all factors that fall into the bottom-right quadrant of Figure 1, the quadrant with the most favorable outcomes, pertain to having a higher education, a higher-paying career, homeownership, general quality of life, social connectivity and being white. For the most part, factors that fall into the top right and bottom left quadrants with mixed outcomes, are educational factors  signifying  a  mid-range  level  of  education,  or  pertain  to  age-related  factors  that  directly  impact vaccine eligibility such as being under 18 years old. Taken together, our findings reiterate what is known about the vast racial and socioeconomic disparities that are still ongoing in the US surrounding the COVID-19pandemic. We find, however, an important and yet-unmentioned relationship between insurance status and vaccine coverage that we feel is addressable through better communication.","Our findings indicate that there are several groups of socioeconomic factors that are related to the percentage of a county that is vaccinated, as well as the incidence of new COVID-19 cases, but these relationships have different strengths and directionalities, highlighting the complexities of socioeconomic disparities  in  the  United  States  and  the  vastness  of  their  impacts.

A  recent  study  from  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and Prevention (CDC) identified that US counties with high social vulnerability according to metrics such as poverty, unemployment, low income, and no high school diploma, have significantly lower rates  of  vaccination  compared  to  the  national  average1.  Here,  we  build  upon  this  analysis  to consider  associations  between  county-level  vaccination  rates  and  68  different  demographic, socioeconomic,  and  environmental  factors  for  1,510  American  counties  with  over  228  million individuals for which vaccination data was also available. Our analysis reveals that counties with high levels of uninsured individuals have significantly lower COVID-19 vaccination rates (Spearman correlation: -0.264), despite the fact that the CDC has mandated that all COVID-19 vaccines are free and cannot be denied to anyone based upon health insurance coverage or immigration status. Furthermore, we find that the counties with high levels of uninsured individuals tend to have the highest COVID-19 incidence rates in March 2021 relative to December 2020 (Spearman correlation: 0.388).  Among  the  68  factors  analyzed,  insurance  coverage  is  the  only  factor  which  is  highly correlated with both vaccination rate and change in COVID-19 incidence during the vaccination period (|Spearman correlation| > 0.25). We also find that counties with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic individuals have significantly lower vaccination rates (Spearman correlations: -0.128, -0.136) and lesser declines of COVID-incidence rates (Spearman correlations: 0.334, 0.330) during the vaccination period. Surprisingly however, after controlling for race, we find that the association between lack of insurance coverage and vaccination rate as well as COVID-19 incidence rates is largely  driven  by  counties  with  a  majority  white  population.  Among  the  counties  with  high proportions of white residents (top 10% decile), the association between insurance coverage and vaccination rate is significant (Spearman correlation: -0.210, p-value: 0.002), but among counties with  low  proportions  of  white  residents  (bottom  10%  decile)  this  association  is  not  significant (Spearman correlation: 0.072, p-value: 0.088). Taken together, this study highlights the fact that intricate socioeconomic factors are correlated not just to COVID-19 vaccination rates, but also to COVID-19  incidence  fluctuations,  underscoring  the  need  to  improve  COVID-19  vaccination campaigns  in  marginalized  communities.  The  strong  positive  correlation  between  low  levels  of health  insurance  coverage  and  low  vaccination  rates  is  particularly  concerning,  and  calls  for improved public health messaging to emphasize the fact that health insurance is not required to be eligible for any of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines in the United States"
Case fatality rates for COVID-19 are higher than case fatality rates for motor vehicle accidents for individuals over 40 years of age,"The death toll of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented, due to both thehigh number of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the seriousness of the disease resulting fromthese infections. Here, we present mortality rates and case fatality rates for COVID-19over the past year compared with other historic leading causes of death in the UnitedStates. Among the risk categories considered, COVID-19 is the third leading cause ofdeath for individuals 40 years old and over, with an overall annual mortality rate of 325deaths per 100K individuals, behind only cancer (385 deaths per 100K individuals) andheart disease (412 deaths per 100K individuals). In addition, for individuals 40 years oldand over, the case  fatality  rate  for  COVID-19  is  greater  than  the  case  fatality  rate  formotor  vehicle accidents. In particular, for the age group 40-49, the relative case fatalityrate of COVID-19 is 1.5 fold (95% CI: [1.3, 1.7]) that of a motor vehicle accident,demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly more dangerous than acar crash for this age group. For older adults, COVID-19 is even more dangerous, and therelative case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 29.4 fold (95% CI: [23.2, 35.7]) that of a motorvehicle accident for individuals over 80 years old. On the other hand, motor vehicleaccidents have a 4.5 fold (95% CI: [3.9, 5.1]) greater relative case fatality rate compared toCOVID-19 for the age group of 20-29 years. These results highlight the severity of theCOVID-19 pandemic especially for adults above 40 years of age and underscore the needfor large-scale preventative measures to mitigate risks for these populations. Given thatFDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have now been validated by multiple studies for theiroutstanding real-world effectiveness and safety,  vaccination  of  all  individuals  who  areover  40  years  of  age  is  one  of  the  most pressing public health priorities of our time.IntroductionAs of April 1, 2021, over 550,000 deaths have beenattributed to COVID-19 in the United States1, more than all of the deaths of American soldiers from the Vietnam war, Korean war, and World War II combined2. However, the disease burden of the pandemic has been largely unequal, and  the  majority  of  COVID-19  deaths  have  been  concentrated  amongolder  adults  (>  65  years old)3and individuals with pre-existing medical conditions4. The CDC has identified these groups of individuals as “highrisk” for severe COVID-19 disease5, and they have beenprioritized in the nationwide  COVID-19  vaccine  rollout,  along  with  healthcare  and  other  essential  workers6. Furthermore,  increased  mortality  rates  have  also  been  observed  among  socioeconomically disadvantaged subgroups and racial minorities3.   .

2Here,  we  assess  the  health  risks  and  disease  burden  for  COVID-19  and  other  leading causes  of  death  in  the  United  States  over  the  past  year,  including:  flu, cancer,  heart  disease, motor  vehicle  accidents,  suicide,  and  homicide.  We  report  the  overall  mortality  rates  and  case fatality rates for 10-year age groups of the population, and we compute the relative risks for each of  the  non-COVID-19  causes  of  death  versus  COVID-19.    For  each  age  group,  we  present  the absolute and relative risks of COVID-19. By placing the mortality risk of COVID-19 in the context of other prominent causes of death, within each age group, this analysis provides a useful point of reference for the danger of COVID-19.MethodsData SourcesPublicly available data was used for this analysis. Population data was obtained from the US Census Bureau7. National-level COVID-19 data was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) public use case surveillance data8. We restricted our analysis to the  CDC-reported  cases  and  deaths  for  the  year  spanning  from  March  15,  2020  to  March  14, 2021. The CDC WONDER public access database was used to get overall mortality risks for a number of familiar causes of death, including heart disease and drug overdoses9. The mortality databases as well as cancer data were queried. In total, data from 4 of the datasets were used: Cancer  Incidence  (2014-2017), Cancer  Mortality  2014-2017), Detailed  Mortality  Underlying Cause of Death (2015-2018), and Detailed Mortality Multiple Cause of Death (2015-2018). 5-year survival numbers for cancer were estimated from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program data10restricted to cases diagnosed from 2002-2016, along with lifetable data obtained from the US Mortality Database (USMDB)11. Overall mortality by motor vehicle accident was computed using the publicly available Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) from the National  Highway  Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA),  which  contains  detailed  information about  all  reported  fatal  accidents12.  Case  fatality  rates  (i.e.  probability  of  dying  conditioned  on being  in  an  accident)  was  derived  from  the  publicly  available  NHTSA  Crash  Report  Sampling System (CRSS)13. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) was used to get survey-based age-specific estimates  of  annual  drug  misuse  and  misuse  rates  (including  opioids  and  heroin)  by  age.  Data was accessed through the survey’s Public-use Data Analysis System14. This was joined with the CDC WONDER drug fatality data, and the fatality numbers were divided by the estimated users to estimate the “conditional risk” of heroin use/opioid misuse. Note that the broadest category of the survey is used for the denominator, so frequent drug users likely have higher risk. Estimated deaths, illnesses, and hospitalizations by age group for influenza in the United States for the 2017-18 and 2018-2019 flu seasons were obtained from a recent CDC report15,16.  Statistical analysisFor each age group and risk category, we computed the following measures:●Prevalence = (Number of cases) / (Total population),●Overall mortality = (Number of deaths) / (Total population),●Case fatality rate = (Number of deaths) / (Number of cases). .

3For the estimates of the overall mortality and case fatality rates, individuals with missing or  unknown  death  status  were  considered  to  be  alive.  The  age  group  specific  prevalence  and overall mortality rate for COVID-19 were calculated by scaling up the number of cases and deaths captured by the CDC public use case surveillance dataset to the total number of cases and deaths reported in the CDC COVID data tracker1during the study period (March 15, 2020 to March 14, 2021). Case fatality rates, along with standard errors, for motor vehicle accidents were computed using the surveypackage17in Rin order to account for the complex survey design. Case fatality rates for individuals in 4-door sedans using no restraint during an accident were computed using the  same  method.  For  cancer, 5-yearmortality  was  used  in  place  of  the  case  fatality  rate.  In particular,  the 5-yearmortality  rates  for  cancer  along  with  standard  errors  were  estimated  from individuals who were diagnosed with cancer between 2002-2016 using the Ederer I method18,19. To compare the overall mortality and case fatality rates between other risks and COVID-19, we computed the following relative risks:●Overall mortality relative risk = (Overall mortality for risk category) / (Overall mortality for COVID-19)●Case fatality rate relative risk = (Case fatality rate for risk category) / (Case fatality rate for COVID-19)In  addition,  95%  confidence  intervals  for  the  relative  risks  were  computed  using  the  delta method20. Rates were considered to be significantly different if the 95% confidence interval for the relative risk values did not contain one. This corresponds to a statistical significance test with p-value < 0.05.We note that for influenza, estimates of case fatality and mortality data were only available for age groups of 0-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+ years old.16In addition, no confidence intervals were reported for the overall mortality and case fatality rate estimates for influenza because only uncertainty intervals were provided from the original data sources.ResultsCOVID-19 is among the top-3 causes of death for individuals over 40 years oldRecently released statistics on the leading causesof death in the United States revealed that  COVID-19  was  the  third  most  prevalent  cause  of  death  in  2020  (377,883  deaths,  11.3%), behind only Heart Disease and Cancer.3We have stratified the mortality rates (deaths by cause per  100k  individuals)  of  a  diverse  set  of  leading  causes  of  death  (defined  in Table S1):  Heart Disease,   Cancer,   COVID-19,   Cerebrovascular   Disease,   Suicide,   Motor   Vehicle   Accidents, Firearm Homicide, and Drug Overdoses, within each 10-year age interval. This analysis reveals that the high overall mortality of COVID-19 is mainly driven by high mortality rates for individuals over the age of 40 years (Figure 1). COVID-19 (red dots in Figure 1) is consistently among the top  three  causesof  death  in  individuals  aged  40  years  or  older.  While  COVID-19  ranks  third among  the  causes  of  mortality  in  both  the  40-49  age  range  as  well  as  the  80+  age  range,  the overall mortality for the 40-49 age group is 21 deaths per 100K individuals, while it is1,028 deaths  .

4per 100K individuals for the age group over 80 years old. These results show that most deaths from COVID-19 are among older age groups, which is consistent with previous studies21,22.Drug overdoses, suicide, and motor vehicle accidents are among the leading causes of death for individuals younger than 40 years oldFor   individuals   under   the   age   of   40,   the   leading   causes   of   death   are   primarily environmental and mental health-related (Figure 1, inset). Drug overdoses are the leading cause of  death  for  the  age  groups  30-39  and  20-29  (37  deaths  and  25  deaths  per  100K  individuals, respectively). Suicide is the second leading cause of death for the age groups 10-19 and 30-39 (6.6 deaths and17 deaths per 100K individuals, respectively), and third for the age group 20-29 (17 deaths per 100K individuals). Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death for the age group 10-19 (7 deaths per 100K individuals) and the second-leading cause of death for the age  group  20-29  (17  deaths  per  100K  individuals).    For  all  age  groups  below  40  years  old,  the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 is low and it declines with each decade of age. There are 13deaths per 100K individuals due to COVID-19 for the age group 30-39 years old, and for the age group 0-9 years old the overall mortality rate is less than one death per 100K individuals. COVID-19 has a higher case fatality rate than motor vehicle accidents for individuals over 40 years oldTo  further  contextualize  the  risk  of  COVID-19  for  individuals  in  varying  age  groups  we analyzed the case fatality rate (CFR). This quantity is defined as the percentage of occurrences of a given event, such as a motor vehicle accident or contracting a disease, that result in death. Specifically,  we  compare  the  CFR  of  COVID-19  to  that  of  motor  vehicle  accidents,  specific cancers with high mortality,23and the 2018-2019 flu (Figure 2). Strikingly, while for individuals in the  younger  age  groups  the  CFR  of  motor  vehicle  accidents  is  significantly  higher  than  that  of COVID-19, the opposite is true for the older age groups. The largest difference, as quantified by the ratio of the motor vehicle accident CFR and the COVID-19 CFR, is observed between the 10-19  age  group  and  the  80+  age  group.  Individuals  in  the  10-19  age  group  involved  in  a  motor vehicle accident have a 13-fold (95% CI: [10, 17]) increased risk of death compared to individuals in  the  same  age  group  who  contract  COVID-19  (Table S2).  Conversely,  individuals  in  the  80+ age  group  who  contract  COVID-19  have  a  29-fold  (95%  CI:  [24,  36])  increased  risk  of  death compared  to  individuals  in  the  same  age  group  whoare  involved  in  a  motor  vehicle  accident (Table  S2).  For  individuals  over  60  years  old,  the  CFR  of  COVID-19  also  surpasses  that  of prostate cancer (Figure 2), further emphasizing the dramatically increased risk of COVID-19 for older  individuals.  While  theCFR  for  flu  is  also  age  dependent,  it  is  significantly lower  than  the CFR for COVID-19 in comparable age-groups. Together, these data show that the risk of death upon contracting COVID-19 is greatly increased in older patients.DiscussionHere  we  have  compared  the  mortality  rate  and  case  fatality  rate  of  COVID-19  to  other leading causes of death3, in the United States, stratified by 10-yearage-groups (Figure 1). We find  that  COVID-19  mortality  rates show  a  strong  age  dependence,  with  COVID-19  mortality increasing from less than 1 death per 100K individuals, for individuals under 20 years old, to 1,900  .

5deaths  per  100K  individuals,  for  individuals  over  80  years  old.  This  increase  in  mortality  can largely be attributed to high CFR in age groups over 40 years (Figure 2), where the risk of death for individuals with COVID-19 is greater than that of same aged individuals involved in a motor vehicle accident. This study also corroborates previous studies on the leading causes of death in the United States. A recent study24in December 2020 found that for the age group 85 years and older, the mortality rates for heart disease, COVID-19, and malignant neoplasms were 2,453 deaths, 1,070 deaths, and 1,044 deaths per 100K individuals respectively, which is similar to reported rates in this study for the age group 80 years and older (2,700 deaths, 1,900 deaths, and 1,500 deaths per 100K individuals, respectively). In addition, the case fatality rates for motor vehicle accidents reported  here  are  consistent  with  data  from  the  AAA  Foundation’s  American  Driving  Survey25, given that the motor vehicle accident CFRcan be approximated as: (Number of Fatal Crashes) / (Total Number of Crashes). Although less pronounced than in the case of COVID-19, pancreatic cancer,  lung  and  bronchus  cancer,  motor  vehicle  accidents,  and  the  flu  also  show  a  near monotonic  increase  in CFR  with  age.  On  the  other  hand,  breast  cancer,  prostatecancer,  and leukemia have local maxima in CFR for younger age groups, consistent with previous studies that identified younger patients have poor prognosis for these types of cancer26,27. There were a number of data challenges which limited the analysis in this study. During the first few months of 2020, counts of COVID-19 reported cases and deaths may be lower than the actual values due to underreporting. Case fatality rate data was sparse for the non-COVID-19 risk categories considered, so we focused the analysis on those categories with data available (e.g. motor vehicle accidents, cancer subtypes, influenza). Outcome measures for different risk categories were available for earlier time periods (e.g. cancer data was taken from 2002-2016), while  COVID-19  outcome  measures  were  taken  from  the  past  year.  As  a  result,  the  outcome measures  for  the  non-COVID-19  risk  categories  may  be  slightly  different  during  the  study  time period from the past year. For example, the case fatality rates for cancer may be overestimated due to advances in cancer treatment28. There  are  multiple  areas  for  futurework.  Here,  we  consider  COVID-19  overall  mortality and case fatality rates as fixed, but it would be interesting to see how these outcome measures have changed over time. For example, we may expect that the mortality rates for COVID-19 have declined  as  therapeutics  such  as  antiviral  treatments29and  monoclonal  antibodies30,31have become available. As more follow-up data becomes available, we can report mortality rates for COVID-19 for longer time horizons. For example, in several years, we could conduct a follow-up study comparing the 5 year mortality rates from long-COVID with the 5 year mortality rates from cancer. In addition, one limitation of this study is that we restricted the analysis to mortality rates in the United States only. It would be interesting to replicate this analysis on data from developing countries  which  may  have  significantly  different  leading  causes  of  death  and  mortality  rates  for COVID-19 and other risk categories.","Here  we  have  compared  the  mortality  rate  and  case  fatality  rate  of  COVID-19  to  other leading causes of death3, in the United States, stratified by 10-yearage-groups (Figure 1).

Here, we present mortality rates and case fatality rates for COVID-19over the past year compared with other historic leading causes of death in the UnitedStates. Among the risk categories considered, COVID-19 is the third leading cause ofdeath for individuals 40 years old and over, with an overall annual mortality rate of 325deaths per 100K individuals, behind only cancer (385 deaths per 100K individuals) andheart disease (412 deaths per 100K individuals). In addition, for individuals 40 years oldand over, the case  fatality  rate  for  COVID-19  is  greater  than  the  case  fatality  rate  formotor  vehicle accidents. In particular, for the age group 40-49, the relative case fatalityrate of COVID-19 is 1.5 fold (95% CI: [1.3, 1.7]) that of a motor vehicle accident,demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly more dangerous than acar crash for this age group. For older adults, COVID-19 is even more dangerous, and therelative case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 29.4 fold (95% CI: [23.2, 35.7]) that of a motorvehicle accident for individuals over 80 years old. On the other hand, motor vehicleaccidents have a 4.5 fold (95% CI: [3.9, 5.1]) greater relative case fatality rate compared toCOVID-19 for the age group of 20-29 years. These results highlight the severity of theCOVID-19 pandemic especially for adults above 40 years of age and underscore the needfor large-scale preventative measures to mitigate risks for these populations. Given thatFDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have now been validated by multiple studies for theiroutstanding real-world effectiveness and safety,  vaccination  of  all  individuals  who  areover  40  years  of  age  is  one  of  the  most pressing public health priorities of our time."
Mapping each pre-existing condition’s association to short-term and long-term COVID-19 complications,"Understanding the relationships between pre-existing conditions and complications of COVID-19 infection is critical to identifying which patients will develop severe disease. Here, we leverage 1.1 million clinical notes from 1,903 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and deep  neural  network  models  to  characterize  associations  between  21  pre-existing conditions and the development of 20 complications (e.g. respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and hematologic) of COVID-19 infection throughout the course of infection(i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days, and 61-90 days). Pleural effusion was the most frequent complication of early COVID-19 infection (23% of 383 complications) followed by cardiac arrhythmia (12% of  383  complications).  Notably,  hypertension  was  the  most  significant  risk  factor associated with 10 different complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia and anemia. Furthermore, novel associations between cancer (risk ratio: 3, p=0.02) or immunosuppression (risk ratio: 4.3,  p=0.04) with early-onset heart failure have also been identified. Onset of new complications after 30 days is rare and most commonly involves pleural effusion (31-60 days: 24% of 45 patients, 61-90 days: 25% of 36 patients). Overall, the associations between pre-COVID conditions and COVID-associated complications presented here may form the basis for the development of risk assessment scores to guide clinical care pathways.IntroductionThe COVID pandemic remains an ongoing public health crisis1, and it is critically important to understand the full spectrum of complications that arise throughout the course of COVID infection. There are already several emerging reports of risk factors of severe disease as wellas lingering long-term effects such as fatigue, myalgia and kidney related complications2. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the relationship between pre-existing comorbidities and post-COVID complications.

2provides a unique opportunity to understand the relationship between comorbidities and COVID complications3. While the structured EHR fields such as ICD codes are modestly informative, the true context of comorbidities and complications are buried inthe 1.1 million+ unstructured patient notes of the 1,903 COVID-19 patients. In this study, we have leveraged ‘augmented curation’ of EHR notes in COVID patients3to map the relationships between complications, comorbidities, and outcomes in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients. MethodsInstitutional Review Board (IRB)This retrospective research was conducted under IRB 20–003278, ‘Study of COVID-19 patient characteristics with augmented curation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) to inform strategic and operational decisions’. For further information regarding the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board  (IRB)  policy,  and  its  institutional  commitment,  membership  requirements,  review  of research,  informedconsent,  recruitment,  vulnerable  population  protection,  biologics,  and confidentiality   policy,   please   refer   towww.mayo.edu/research/institutional-review-board/overview.Study designIn this study, we consider all hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients (positive PCR for SARS-CoV2) in the Mayo Clinic electronic health record (EHR) database from March 12, 2020 to September 15, 2020 (1,903 patients total).  An overview of the clinical characteristics of this study population is provided in Table 1.  In order to capture the complications and comorbidities recorded in the clinical notes with positive sentiment, we ran the 1.1 million patient notes through a neural network based software that captures the sentiments of phenotypes from clinical notes. For comorbidities, we considered 21 risk factors for COVID-19 severe illness reported by the CDC4, including: (1) anemia, (2) asthma, (3) BMI between 25-30 (overweight), (4) BMI between 30-40 (obese), (5) BMI >= 40 (severe obesity), (6) cancer, (7) cardiomyopathy, (8) chronic kidney disease (CKD), (9) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (10)coronary artery disease (CAD), (11) heart failure (HF), (12) hyperglycemia, (13) hypertension, (14) immunosuppressant medication usage, (15) liver disease, (16) neurologic conditions, (17) obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), (18) smoker (former or current), (19) steroid medication usage, (20) type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), (21) type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).  We also note that bone marrow transplant, HIV/AIDS,  pediatric  conditions,  pregnancy,  sickle  cell  disease,  solid  organ  transplant,  and thalassemia were also considered, but were not included in the analysis because fewer than 20 patients had each of these comorbidities.  For complications, we considered 20 COVID-associated complications: (1) acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury (ARDS /ALI), (2) acute kidney injury (AKI), (3) anemia, (4) cardiac  arrest,  (5)  cardiac  arrhythmias,  (6)  chronic  fatigue  syndrome,  (7)  disseminated  .

3intravascular  coagulation  (DIC),  (8)  heart  failure,  (9)  hyperglycemia,  (10)  hypertension,  (11) myocardial infarction (MI), (12) pleural effusion, (13) pulmonary embolism (PE), (14)  respiratory failure,  (15)  sepsis,  (16)  septic  shock,  (17)  stroke  /  cerebrovascular  incident,  (18)  venous thromboembolism / deep vein thrombosis (VTE / DVT), (19) delirium/encephelopathy, and (20) numbness.A  patient  was  determined  to  have  a  clinical  phenotype  (the  comorbidity  or  complication,  in question) if the clinical phenotype or synonyms were mentioned (with positive sentiment) within that patients’ electronic health records. For comorbidities, the mention must have occurred within a note at any point in the patient history prior to the patient’s first positive COVID-19 PCR test.  Patients were only considered if they had at least one note within Mayo Clinic EHR system dated before days -31 relative to their first positive PCR test. For the patients included in this study, we stratified the rates of new onset complications by comorbidities (Table 2). For each comorbidity, e.g. chronic kidney disease, we compare the rates of “new onset” complications in cohorts of COVID-19 patients with and without chronic kidney disease. To calculate the rate of a new-onset complication, e.g. acute kidney injury (AKI), the numerator  is  the  number  of  patients  with  AKI  recorded  in  the  clinical  notes  (with  positive sentiment) during but not prior to the time period.  The denominator is the number of patients without AKI recorded in the clinical notes with positive sentiment prior to the time period. Augmented curation to identify comorbidities and complications in clinical notesAn augmented curation approach was used to classify the sentiment of phenotypes mentioned in the clinical notes.  In order to determine if a patient is indicative of a comorbidity or complication, we used a system consisting of:●A high performance text retrieval and search engine that given a patient cohort consisting of one or more patients, pipes all the sentences, paragraphs and documents pertaining to those patients to a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system●An NER system consisting of both a knowledge graph based entity recognition subsystem as well as a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based5entity recognition system that, given any  sentence or paragraph is able to identity whether it contains one or more phenotypes (comorbidities or complications etc.) so that all such sentences and paragraphs then are piped to a further downstream phenotype sentiment classification system. ●A  BERT-based  phenotype  sentiment  model3that  given  a  sentence  or  paragraph containing a phenotype/disease token provides accurately the sentiment as to whether or not the sentence indicates if the patient has the disease or not. ●A system that aggregates, patient-wise, all the sentence/paragraph sentiments, grouped by disease, and uses practical heuristics to determine if the patient may be confidently deemed  to  have  the  disease,  based  on  the  sentence  level  sentiments.    As  part  of immediate future work, we are developing formal Bayesian models to aggregate the sentence level BERT sentiment information into a sound patient level sentiment inference.  .

4Presently we use heuristics based on the number of positive sentiment sentences found in a patient’s notes to deem whether or not the patient has a disease. Validation of the augmented curation modelIn  order  to  validate  the  augmented  curation  model  for  a  set  of  phenotypes  of complications/comorbidities, we manually labelled a set of 2,404 randomly selected sentences from the clinical notes containing the phenotypes.  The true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates are reported in Supplementary Table S1.Overall, the out-of-sample precision, recall, and accuracy values were 0.980, 0.982, and 0.966, respectively.  ResultsPatient characteristics1,903 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19between March 12, 2020 and October 15, 2020.  Using the date of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, we analyzed the clinical notes of each patient in their pre-COVID vs the post-COVID19 phase (Figure 1A). Using deep language models (Figure 1B) we extracted the 20 risk factors for COVID-19 severe illness reported by the CDC (Figure 1C) and the 18 COVID-associated complications (Figure 1D) in order to analyze their association in our cohort (Figure 2-4).In Table 1,we present the general characteristicsof the study population. All age groups are included, and, as expected from the severity of the disease in different age groups, more than 50% of the patients were over 50 year-old with only 2.6% of pediatric patients. Female, male and different ethnic origins of the US population are adequately represented. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (42.8%), diabetes/hyperglycemia (38%), obesity (25.2%) and cancer (21.1%), reflecting the most common causes of chronic diseases in the US.The most common COVID complications recorded were respiratory (ARDS, respiratory failure, pulmonary  embolism),  followed  by  cardiovascular  (hypertension,  myocardial  infarction, arrhythmia,   stroke),   acute   kidney   injury,   anemia,   sepsis   and   diabetic decompensation/hyperglycemia (Figure 1D).Frequency of COVID-19 complications and association with underlying comorbiditiesThe main objective of our analysis was to identify the association between comorbidities and short-term (up to 30 days post-infection) and long-term (31-90 days post-infection) complications of COVID-19 infection. Here, we observe the majority of complications occur within the first month post-infection (Figure 1D). We  identify  multiple  comorbidities  that  are  associated  with  significantly  higher  rates  of  any complications in the early onset time period (Days 0-30 post-PCR diagnosis). From this analysis, we  validate  that  many  of  the  CDC-reported  risk  factors  for  COVID-19  severe  illness  are associated  with  increased  rates  of  early  onset  COVID  complications  across  multiple  organ  .

Among these we identify hypertension (RR: 9.4, p-value: 2.9e-64) as the most significant risk factor followed by other cardiovascular chronic disease (heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy), anemia (RR: 3.2, p-value: 9.8e-14) and chronic kidney disease (RR: 4.4, p-value: 1.5e-22), as the most significant predictors of clinical complication in early COVID-19 infection. Respiratory complications Pleural effusionsare the most common early onset complications: 23% within the first months and 7% for ARDS/ALI, the second most frequent complication (Figure 1D). The primary risk factor for pleural effusion was hypertension (RR 9.2, p = 2.4e-22) (Figure 2, Table 3). While the risk of new onset of pleural effusion is reduced after a month, our data reveal persistent risk of pleural effusion beyond 30 days post-infection, particularly among patients with type 1 diabetes (~5%) (Figures 3,4).Acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury is the second most frequent and is the most dreaded complication of severe COVID-19 infection (7%) (Figure 1D). In the early stages  of  COVID  infection  (i.e.  0-30  days  post-infection),  ARDS/ALI  was  most  significantly associated with hypertension  (p-value: 4.2e-8). The other most significantly associated baseline comorbidities include anemia (p-value: 2.9e-4) and chronic kidney disease (2.7e-3) (Figure 2).  In later stages of  infection, we observe additional instances of ARDS/ALI, but at lower  rates. Further, in later stages of infection, we fail to observe significant associations between baseline comorbidities and increased risk of new onset of ARDS/ALI (Figures 3,4, Table 3). Cardiovascular complicationsCardiac  arrhythmia was  the  most  common  cardiovascular  complication  following  COVID infection (12%) (Figure 1D). Hypertension is by far the most important risk factor (RR= 21, p = 2.7e-19) (Table 3).Up to 7% of hypertensive patients present with this complication within the first 30 days (Figure 2).But the risk declines to less than 1% for new onset after one month post-infection (Figures 3,4). Early onset COVIDheart failureis the second most common cardiovascular complication (9%) (Figure 1D). It is primarily associated with coronary heart disease (RR=7.3, p=2.9e-3) and other cardiovascular  risk  factors  (hypertension,  anemia,  type  2  diabetes,  smoking) (Table 3).  But interestingly,  cancer  and  immunosuppression  are  also  uncovered  as  significant  risk  factors (RR=5.1 and 4.5, P = 4.0e-4 and 0.04, respectively). The cardiovascular complications examined in this study occur most frequently in days 0-30 post-infection(Figure 2). Beyond 30 days, the risk  of  new-onset  arrhythmia,  hypertension,  MI,  PE/DVT  dropped  to  less  than  1%  for  all comorbidities (Figures 3,4). Renal complications.Acute kidney injury is among the most common early-onset post-COVID complications (7%), (Figure 1D) and is associated in our cohort mostly with hypertension (RR=11, p=1.2e-7), and chronic kidney disease (RR 8.9, p=4.1e-6) (Table 3)(Figure 2). Specifically, we observe acute kidney injury in 7% of hospitalized COVID patients in aggregate in early infection. The risk  of  .

6acute kidney injury is highest in the early stages of infection (i.e. 0-30 days post-infection), while there is a reduction in the new onset of acute kidney injury beyond 30 days (either 31-60 days or 61-90 days) (Figures 3,4). Neurologic ComplicationsEncephalopathy and deliriumare a commonly observed complication of COVID (c), which is most associated in our cohort with heart failure (RR = 11, p = 3.9e-5), hypertension (RR = 7.2, p = 3.3e-4), and coronary artery disease(RR = 9.2, p = 7.5e-4) (Table 3). Further, the risk of encephalopathy and delirium was observed to be highest in early COVID infection (Figures 3,4). Predictors of long-term complications of COVID-19 infectionWhile we observe a substantial reduction in the frequency of new onset of complications beyond 30 days post-infection, the risk of some complications is non-zero. In the case of pleural effusion, the risk decreases from 10-15% for all patients to less than1% (Figures 2,3,4)with increased risk in patients with cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure and hypertension. Patients with liver disease, stroke and type 1 diabetes also appear more susceptible to late-onset complications (days 31-90) (Figure 3,4).DiscussionIn  the  present  study  we  have  set  out  to  understand  the  relationship  between  baseline comorbidities and clinical complications over the course of COVID-19 infection. Here, we leverage natural language processing of unstructured patient notes from 1,903 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Mayo Clinic health system. While it stands to reason that individuals with poorer health  status  and  multiple  underlying  comorbidities  will  experience  worse  outcomes during COVID-19 infection, our study reveals that not all risk factors are created equal and are associated with  different  complications.  Previous  studies  have  begun  to  uncover  numerous  factors associated with increased risk of more severe COVID-19 infection6–10including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy. In general, these studies have examined risk of severe COVID-19 infection, but have not examined the relationship between baseline comorbidities and risk of specific complications. In our analysis, we observe that hypertension is the single most significant risk factor for all examined complications with exception of deepvein thrombosis. Notably, this is consistent with previous studies,, where patients with baseline hypertension have been reported to have higher risk of more severe COVID-19 disease7,8. Specifically, our data suggest that a recent history of hypertension  is  the  strongest  predictor  of  ARDS,  the  most  significant  and  life-threatening complication  of  COVID-19,  among  hospitalized  COVID-19  patients,  similar  to  previous observations10.  We  further  observed  anemia,  chronic  kidney  disease,  immunosuppression, coronary artery disease and hyperglycemia to be associated with increased rates of ARDS. Our analysis  further  uncovered  unexpected  associations  likebetween  a  history  of  cancer  and immunosuppression with heart failure following COVID-19 infection. Our  data  also  highlight  the  temporal  relationship  between  baseline  health  status  and complications throughout COVID-19 infection. For example, cancer, obesity, and obstructive  .

7sleep apnea are associated with higher rates of short-term complications (days 0-30 post-PCR test), but not with late-onset complications. While many  comorbidities are chronic (e.g. cancer, obesity, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease), others are amenable to short-term intervention,  suggesting  that  tight  control  of  modifiable  risk  factors  might  limit  the  risk  of complication  due  to  COVID-19  infection.  For  example,  controlling  hypertension,  smoking cessation,  treating  anemia,  and  having  tight  glycemic  control  might  reduce  the  rate  of cardiovascular complications in the early stages of COVID-19.  Many of the comorbidities examined likely influence the development of complications, even in the absence of COVID-19 infection. For example, we do not observe new-onset pleural effusion among patients with pre-existing liver disease. It is possible that this is related to previous incidence of pleural effusion among patients with liver disease11. In the present analysis of  the relationship  between  baseline  co-morbidities  and  the  likelihood  of  developing  severe complications, we are not using a reference population of COVID-19 negative individuals. Instead, to understand these relationships, we have limited our inquiry to hospitalized COVID-19 patients and examined differences in the rates of clinical complications and various comorbidities. In future analyses, we will explore the rate of clinical complications in a control population of hospitalized COVID-negative patients to establish baseline complication rates within a hospitalized population. At  present,  our  analysis  does  not  account  for  the  co-dependent  relationships  between comorbidities or between complications. In many cases, individual patients likely have multiple complications, which can obscure the interpretation of data, particularly at later time points where we observe fewer events. Additionally, it is possible that many of the late-stage complications arise directly from baseline comorbidities rather than a direct result of COVID19 infection. This study can be leveraged for the development of controlled trials to identify appropriate prophylactic or  therapeutic  interventions  for  high-risk  COVID-19  patients.  Future  analyses  will  focus  on creation of a multivariate model to enable risk prediction of post-COVID complications","In  the  present  study  we  have  set  out  to  understand  the  relationship  between  baseline comorbidities and clinical complications over the course of COVID-19 infection.

Future  analyses  will  focus  on creation of a multivariate model to enable risk prediction of post-COVID complications","Understanding the relationships between pre-existing conditions and complications of COVID-19 infection is critical to identifying which patients will develop severe disease. Here, we leverage 1.1 million clinical notes from 1,903 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and deep  neural  network  models  to  characterize  associations  between  21  pre-existing conditions and the development of 20 complications (e.g. respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and hematologic) of COVID-19 infection throughout the course of infection(i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days, and 61-90 days). Pleural effusion was the most frequent complication of early COVID-19 infection (23% of 383 complications) followed by cardiac arrhythmia (12% of  383  complications).  Notably,  hypertension  was  the  most  significant  risk  factor associated with 10 different complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia and anemia. Furthermore, novel associations between cancer (risk ratio: 3, p=0.02) or immunosuppression (risk ratio: 4.3,  p=0.04) with early-onset heart failure have also been identified. Onset of new complications after 30 days is rare and most commonly involves pleural effusion (31-60 days: 24% of 45 patients, 61-90 days: 25% of 36 patients). Overall, the associations between pre-COVID conditions and COVID-associated complications presented here may form the basis for the development of risk assessment scores to guide clinical care pathways."
FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are effective per real-world evidence synthesized across a multi-state health system,"Large Phase 3 clinical trials of the two FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), have demonstrated efficacies of 94.1% (n  =  30,420,  95%  CI:  89.3-96.8)  and  95%  (n  =  43,448,  95%  CI:  90.3-97.6)  in  preventing symptomatic  COVID-19,  respectively.  Given  the  ongoing  vaccine  rollout  to  healthcare personnel  and  residents  of  long-term  care  facilities,  here  we  provide  a  preliminary assessment of real-world vaccination efficacy in 62,138 individuals from the Mayo Clinic and associated health system (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin) between December 1st2020  and  February  8th2021.  Our  retrospective  analysis  contrasts  31,069  individuals receiving at least one dose of either vaccine with 31,069 unvaccinated individuals whoare propensity-matched  based  on  demographics,  location  (zip  code),  and  number  of  prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. 8,041 individuals received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and were  at  risk  for  infection  at  least  36  days  after  their  first  dose.    Administrationof  two COVID-19 vaccine doses was 88.7% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%)  with  onset  at  least  36  days  after  the  first  dose.  Furthermore,  vaccinated patients who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 had significantly lower 14-day hospital admission rates than propensity-matched unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relative Risk: 0.4; p-value: 0.007). Building upon the previous randomized trials of these vaccines, this study demonstrates their real-world effectiveness in reducing the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity among individuals at highest risk for infection.IntroductionTo  date  there  have  been  over  107  million  confirmed  cases  of  COVID-19  and  over  2.3 million associated deaths globally (1). From the moment that SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative  agent  of  COVID-19,  efforts  were  initiated  to  characterize  this  virus  and  to  develop vaccines  against  it  (2, 3, 4).  Within  months,  several  candidates  were  shown  to  be  safe  and  to induce robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in a series of early phase trials (5, 6, 7,  .

28).  More  recently,  multiple  vaccine  candidates  have  shown  over  94%  efficacy  in  preventing symptomatic  COVID-19  infection  in  large  phase  3  clinical  trials  (9, 10).  Of  note,  unlike  the seasonal  flu  vaccine,  both  of  these  candidates  are  delivered  as  a  series  of  two  inoculations separated by three or four weeks, with maximal response believed to be achieved by one to two weeks after the second dose (5, 6, 9, 10).In a phase 3 trial studying BNT162b2 (9), the COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Pfizer/BioNTech,  50  out  of  21,314  (0.23%)  vaccinated  patients  experienced  a  symptomatic COVID-19 infection, with anincidence rate of 12.5 cases per 1000 person-years. In contrast, 275 of 21,258 (1.29%) patients receiving a placebo injection developed COVID-19, with an incidence rate of 69.1 cases per 1000 person-years. Thirty patients experienced severe disease, all of whom had received placebo. Seven or more days after the second dose, the difference between groups was even more pronounced, with incidence rates of 3.61 and 72.9 cases per 1000 person-years in the vaccinated and placebo groups, respectively (efficacy = 95.0%; 95% CI: 90.3-97.6%).Similarly,  in  the  trial  studying  mRNA-1273  (10),  the  vaccine  candidate  developed  by Moderna,   19   of   14,550   (0.13%)   vaccinated   patients   experienced   a   symptomatic   infection compared  to  269  of  14,598  (1.84%)  patients  receiving  placebo.  Among  these  symptomatic infections, there were 9 cases of severe COVID-19 in the placebo group compared to only one in the vaccinated cohort. This effect was stronger when considering infection rates 14 or more days after the second dose, with incidence rates of 3.3 and 56.5 cases per 1000 person-years in the vaccinated and placebo groups, respectively (efficacy = 94.1%; 95% CI: 89.3-96.8%).Both  BNT162b2  and  mRNA-1273  are  now  being  administered  throughout  the  United States under an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA, with first priority given to individuals at high risk for becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 or experiencing severe COVID-19, including healthcare workers and residents of long termcare facilities (11). While these groups were not excluded from the phase 3 trials, vaccine efficacy has not been specifically demonstrated among them. It is thus critical to analyze outcomes of vaccinated patients to date to determine whether these vaccines are indeed effective in especially high-risk individuals. Here  we  conducted  a  large-scale  real  world  interim  analysis  of  COVID-19  vaccination outcomes in the United States. Specifically, we assessed the rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and severity of COVID-19 among 31,069 individuals who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 in the Mayo Clinic health system, including sites in Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, and Wisconsin.  One  challenge  inherent  to  such  real  world  analyses  is  the  lack  of  a  built-in  placebo arm, which is essential to establish the expected infection rate during the study period and thereby to  assess  vaccine  efficacy.  To  address  this  shortcoming,  we  used  1-to-1  propensity  score matching to generate a cohort of 31,069 individuals who were not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and did not receive a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the study period (Figure 1, Table 1).  This  control  arm  was  balanced  for  potential  confounding  factors  for  COVID-19  infection, including: demographics, location (zip code), and number of PCR tests received prior to the study period.    Using  this  control  arm,  we  compared  rates  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  during  defined intervals after study enrollment.  In  addition,  in  order  to  evaluate  the  potential  impact  of  COVID-19  vaccination  upon disease severity, we conducted a similar matched analysis on the 263 vaccinated individuals who  .

3subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period following their first dose of vaccine.  In particular, we used 1-to-10 propensity score matching to generate a cohort of 2,630 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period who never received any vaccination for COVID-19.    This  control  arm  wasbalanced  for  potential  confounding  factors  for severity of COVID-19 illness, including demographics and comorbidities identified from the clinical notes in the Mayo Clinic electronic health records for these patients.  Using this control arm, we compared rates of hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality in the 14 days following the date of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.  MethodsStudy design, setting and populationThis  is  a  retrospective  study  of  individuals  who  underwent  polymerase  chain  reaction (PCR) testing for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the Mayo Clinic and hospitals affiliated to the Mayo health system. This study was reviewed and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB 20-003278) as a minimal risk study. Subjects were excluded if they did not have a research authorization on file. The IRB approved was titled: Study of COVID-19 patient characteristics  with  augmented  curation  of  Electronic  Health  Records  (EHR)  to  inform  strategic and operational decisions with the Mayo Clinic.In total, there were 507,525 patients in the Mayo electronic health record (EHR) database who received a PCR test between February 15, 2020 and February 8, 2021.  To obtain the study population,  we  defined  the  following  inclusion  criteria:  (1)  at  least  18  years  old;  (2)  no  positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before December 1, 2020; (3) resides in a locale (based on Zip code) with at  least  25  patients  who  have  received  BNT162b2  or  mRNA-1273.  This  population  included 249,708 patients, of whom 31,623 have received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 and 218,085 have no  record  of  COVID-19  vaccination.Vaccinated  individuals  who  had  tested  positive  for  SARS-CoV-2 by PCR between December 1, 2020 and the date of their first vaccine dose were excluded, resulting  in  31,299  individuals.  Individuals  with  zero  follow-up  days  after  vaccination  (i.e.  those who  received  the  first  vaccine  dose  on  the  date  of  data  collection)  were  also  excluded,  leaving 31,069  patients  in  the  final  vaccinated  cohort.  Propensity  matched  unvaccinated  cohorts  for analyses   of   vaccine   efficacy   were   selected   from   the   previously   derived   set   of   218,085 unvaccinated patients. This patient selection algorithm and its associated counts are summarized in Figure 1A. More details on the propensity score matching procedure for the vaccine efficacy analysis are provided in the next section.  We  conducted  a  similar  matching  analysis  to  assess  the  impact  of  vaccination  upon COVID-19  disease  severity.    For  this  analysis,  we  considered  the  263  vaccinated  patients  who tested  positive  for  SARS-CoV-2  following  their  first  vaccine  dose  during  the  study  period,  and 14,512 unvaccinated patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period.  For each  of  the  263  SARS-CoV-2  positive  vaccinated  patients,  we  selected  10  controls  from  the unvaccinated  cohort  using  1-to-10  propensity  score  matching.    This  patient  selection  algorithm and  its  associated  counts  are  summarized  in Figure 1B.  More  details  on  the  propensity  score matching procedures for the disease severity analysis are provided in a subsequent section.   .

4Propensity score matching to select theunvaccinated cohort for efficacy analysisWe  employed  1:1  propensity  score  matching  (12)  to  construct  an  unvaccinated  cohort similar   to   the   vaccinated   cohort   on   key   risk   factors   for   SARS-CoV-2   infection,   including geography,  demographics,  and  records  of  PCR  testing.  Specifically,  first  we  matched  exactly based  on  geography  (zip  code  of  the  patient’s  residence).  Next,  we  used  propensity  score matching  to  match  approximately  based  upon  demographic  features  (age,  sex,  race,  ethnicity) and records of PCR testing (number of negative PCR tests taken between February 8, 2020 and November 30, 2020); the number of negative PCR tests covariate serves as a proxy for ongoing baseline  exposure  to  COVID.  To  obtain  the  propensity  scores  for  the  matching  procedure,  we trained  regularized  logistic  regression  models  for  each  zip  code  using  the  software  package sklearn v0.20.3 in Python.  Using these propensity scores, we then matched each of the 31,299 vaccinated patients (who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  BNT162b2  or  mRNA-1273  and  had  not  tested  positive  for SARS-CoV-2 between December 1, 2020 and the date of their first vaccination) with 1 patient out of   the   218,085   unvaccinated   patients,   using   greedy   nearest-neighbor   matching   without replacement(13). In particular, for each vaccinated patient, we selected an unvaccinated patient that lived in the same zip code with the closest propensity score to the vaccinated patient. The cohorts  were  then  subsetted  to  only  include  the  31,069  vaccinated  individuals  (and  their corresponding propensity matched individuals) who had at least one day of follow-up after their date of study enrollment.For each vaccinated patient, the date of study enrollment (Day 0) was defined as the date of  their  first  vaccine  dose.    For  each  unvaccinated  patient,  the  date  of  study  enrollment  was defined as the date of the first vaccine dose for their matched vaccinated patient. The resulting cohorts are summarized in Table 1along with the standardized mean differences (SMD) of their clinical covariates (14, 15). Overall, there is no substantial difference between the two cohorts in any of the clinical covariates that were included in propensity score matching (with SMD < 0.1 for all covariates). The age distributions of patients in the vaccinated, unmatched unvaccinated, and propensity matchedunvaccinated cohorts are shown in Figure S1A-B. Additional data regarding the mean follow-up time, the number of vaccine doses received, and the number of patients taking at least one SARS-CoV-2 PCR test after the study enrollment date are provided in Table S1. The distribution of total follow-up time(i.e. days between first vaccine dose and the end of the data collection period) for the 31,299 vaccinated patients is provided in Figure S2A.Evaluation of vaccine efficacyTo evaluate the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in a real-world clinical setting, we compared the  two  populations  described  above  and  summarized  in Figure  1:  (1)  31,069  individuals  with follow-up who received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 and did not have a prior positive SARS-CoV-2  PCR  test  (“vaccinated”),  and  (2)  31,069  propensity  matched  individuals  who  have  never received a COVID-19 vaccine and did not have a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before the first vaccination date (dose 1) of their matched patient (“unvaccinated”).  Cumulative  proportional  incidence  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  was  compared  between vaccinated   and   unvaccinated   patients   by   Kaplan   Meier   analysis.   Cumulative   proportional  .

5incidence  at  time tis  the  estimated  proportion  of  patients  who  experience  the  outcome  on  or before time t, i.e. 1 minus the standard Kaplan-Meier survival estimate. We considered cumulative incidence starting at Day 1, Day 14, and Day 28 relative to the date of study enrollment (Day 0). Statistical significance was assessed with the log rank test (16). Efficacy was also assessed during defined intervals by computing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. Efficacy was defined as 100% x (1 -IRR). The time  periods  considered  were  as  follows:  (1)  Day  1  onwards,  (2)  Day  15  onwards,  (3)  Day  29 onwards, (4) Day 36 onwards, and (5) six one-week intervals starting one day after the first dose of vaccination (“Day 1”). Only six one-week intervals were considered because less than 25% of the  patients  in  each  cohort  had  adequate  follow-up  to  contribute  at-risk  person  days  after  this time. For each cohort in a given time period, incidence rates were calculated as the number of patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in that time period divided by the total number of at-risk person-days contributed in that time period. For each patient, at-risk person-days are defined as the number of days in the time period in which the patient has not yet tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or died. The IRR was calculated as the incidence rate of the vaccinated cohort divided by the  incidence  rate  of  the  unvaccinated  cohort,  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  was  computed using an exact approach described previously (17).Propensity  score  matching  to  select  the  unvaccinated  COVID-19  patients  for  disease severity analysisSimilarly,  we  applied  1:10  propensity  score  matching  (12)  to  construct  a  SARS-CoV-2 positive unvaccinated cohort similar in baseline clinical covariates to the cohort of patients who were  vaccinated  and  subsequently  tested  positive  for  SARS-CoV-2.  In  particular,  we  used propensity score matching to match approximately based upon demographic features (age, sex, race,  ethnicity)  and  comorbidities  (asthma,  cancer,  cardiomyopathy,  chronic  kidney  disease, chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  coronary  artery  disease,  heart  failure,  hypertension, obesity,   pregnancy,   severe   obesity,   sickle   cell   disease,   solid   organ   transplant,   stroke   / cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus). This list of comorbidities was derived from the list  of  risk  factors  for  severe  COVID-19  illness  provided  by  the  Centers  of  Disease  Control  and Prevention (18). We used deep neural networks to automatically identify comorbidities from the clinical notes, which are described in the next section. To obtain the propensity scores, we trained a  regularized  logistic  regression  model  with  these  features  using  the  software  package  sklearn v0.20.3 in Python.Based  on  these  propensity  scores,  we  matched  each  of  the  263  individuals  that  tested positive  for  SARS-CoV-2  after  vaccination  with  10  individuals  out  of  the  14,512  individuals  that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and that were not vaccinated.  As in the previous propensity score matching procedure, we used greedy nearest-neighbor matching without replacement(13). The resulting cohorts are summarized in Table 3, along with the SMDs for the clinical covariates that were balanced upon (14, 15). Overall, there is no significant difference between the two cohortsin any of the clinical covariates that were included in propensity score matching (with SMD < 0.1 for   all   covariates).   The   age   distributions   of   COVID-19   patients   in   the   vaccinated   cohort, unmatched  unvaccinated  cohort,  and  propensity  matched  unvaccinated cohort  are  shown  in  .

6Figure S1C-D. The distribution of total follow-up time (i.e. days between diagnosis date and the end of the data collection period) is provided in Figure S2B.For each SARS-CoV-2 positive patient in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, the  index  date  for  the  analysis  (day  0)  was  taken  to  be  the  date  of  the  first  positive  PCR  test.  Clinical outcomes at 14 days were compared, including hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality.  Evaluation of disease severityWe  compare the  clinical  outcomes  of  vaccinated  and  propensity-matched  unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2  positive  patients  in  order  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  COVID-19  vaccination  upon disease severity.  Among the patients in each cohort with at least 14 days of follow-up after their first positive PCR test (n = 191 vaccinated, 2,348 unvaccinated), we evaluate: (1) 14-day hospital admission  rate:  Number  of  patients  admitted  to  the  hospital  in  the  two  weeks  following  their positive PCR test, (2) 14-day ICU admission rate: Number of patients admitted to the ICU in the two  weeks  following  their  positive  PCR  test,  and  (3)  14-day  mortality  rate:  Number  of  patients deceased  in  the  two  weeks  following  their  positive  PCR  test.  For  each  outcome,  we  report  the relative risk (rate in the vaccinated cohort divided by the rate in the matched unvaccinated cohort), 95%  confidence  interval  for  the  relative  risk  (19),  and  Fisher’s  exact  test  p-value.  Hospital-free and ICU-free survival were also compared via Kaplan-Meier analysis, with statistical significance assessed with the log rank test (16).Deep neural networks to identify comorbidities from clinical notesIn order to identify the comorbidities from the electronic health record for each patient, we used a BERT-based neural network model (20) to classify the sentiment for the phenotypes that appeared in the clinical notes. In particular, we applied a phenotype sentiment classification model that had been trained on 18,500 sentences which achieves an out-of-sample accuracy of 93.6% with precision and recall scores above 95% (21). This classification model predicts four classes, including: (1) “Yes”: confirmed diagnosis (2) “No”: ruled-out diagnosis, (3) “Maybe”: possibility of disease, and (4) “Other”: alternate context (e.g. family history of disease). For each patient, we applied the sentiment model to the clinical notes in the Mayo Clinic electronic health record from December  1,  2015  to  November  30,  2020.  For  each  comorbidity  phenotype,  if  a  patient  had  at least  one  mention  of  the  phenotype  during  the  time  period  with  a  confidence  score  of  90%  or greater, then the patient was labelled as having the phenotype.  ResultsCOVID-19 vaccines reduce the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infectionOver  the  duration  of  our  study  (see Methods),  263  of  31,069  (0.85%)  vaccinated individuals  tested  positive  for  SARS-CoV-2  compared  to  661  of  31,069  (2.13%)  matched unvaccinated individuals (Table 2, Figure 1). The incidence rates of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests in  the  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  cohorts  were  0.31  and  0.8  cases  per  1000  person-days, respectively.  This  corresponds  to  a  vaccine  efficacy  of  60.7%  (95%  CI:  54.6-66.1%)  over  the  .

7entire study period, and a log-rank test indicates that the hazard rate is significantly lower in the vaccinated  cohort  over  this  time  interval  (p  =5x10-40; Figure  2A).  The  hazard  rates  were  also significantly lower in the vaccinated group when considering SARS-CoV-2 infections with onset at 14 days after study enrollment (p = 1x10-28; Figure 2B) or 28 days after study enrollment (p = 2.4x10-13; Figure 2C).  For  the  263  vaccinated  individuals  who  subsequently  tested  positive  for SARS-CoV-2,  the  distribution  of  time  from  first  dose  to  first  positive  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  test  is shown in Figure 3.Starting 36 days after study enrollment(approximately two weeks after the second dose of  BNT162b2  and  one  week  after  the  second  dose  of  mRNA-1273),  the  vaccinated  and unvaccinated incidence rates were 0.071 and 0.43 case per 1000 person-days, respectively. This corresponds to a vaccine efficacy of 83.4% (95% CI: 60.2-94.3%) (Table 2). Importantly, we found that two  of  the  six infections  in  the  vaccinated cohort  on  or  after day  36  occurred  in  individuals who  had  received  only  one  vaccine  dose,  even  though  all  vaccinated  individuals  should  have received  two  doses  by  this  time  point  per  the  manufacturer  guidelines.  Among  the  properly vaccinated individuals (i.e. those who had received both doses prior to day 36), the incidence rate of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was 0.048 cases per 1000 person-days (4 cases in 82,686 person days), indicating anefficacy of 88.7% (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%) (Table 2). We  also  assessed  the  rates  of  infection  and  estimated  vaccine  efficacy  in  six  non-overlapping 7-day intervals starting at the date of first vaccination. Even in the first seven days after  study  enrollment,  vaccinated  individuals  had  significantly  lower  infection  incidence  rates (0.48  cases  per  1000  person-days)  than  unvaccinated  individuals  (1.0  cases  per  1000  person-days), corresponding to an efficacy of 53.6% (95% CI: 40.9%-63.8%) (Table 2). The vaccination efficacy then generally increased in subsequent weeks, reaching its maximum (92.5%; 95% CI: 70.2-99.1%) during the sixth week after study enrollment (days 36-42) (Table 2). COVID-19  vaccines  are  associated  with  lower  hospitalization  rates  post  SARS-CoV-2 infectionTo assess whether vaccination also reduces illness severity, we compared 14-day rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality in COVID-19 patients who were vaccinated prior to diagnosis (n = 263) and 1-to-10 propensity score matched unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (n = 2,630) (see Methodsand Table 3). The vaccinated population showed a significantly lower 14-day hospital admission rate (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relative Risk = 0.4; p = 0.0074) (Figure 4A, Table 4).  On  the  other  hand,  ICU  admission  rates  were  similar  between  these  cohorts  (1%  vs.  1.3%; Relative Risk = 0.82; p = 1.0) (Figure 4B, Table 4). 14-day conditional mortality rates were also not significantly different (0% vs. 0.085%; Relative Risk = 0; p = 1.0), but it is worth noting that no vaccinated  patients  died  within  14  days  of  acquiring  COVID-19  (Table  4).  In  fact,  none  of  the vaccinated  patients  who  were  subsequently  diagnosed  with  COVID-19  have  died,  including  59 with at least 28 days of follow-up (data not shown).  .

8DiscussionRecent phase 3 trials have led to the authorization of two COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, and other vaccines have been approved in other countries or show promise for approval in  the  near  future  (7, 8).  This  study  provides  strong  further  evidence  supporting  the  use  of vaccination to prevent and reduce the severity of COVID-19. While other real world analyses of COVID-19  vaccines  are  now  emerging  (22),  a  defined  placebo  group  or  adequately  balanced unvaccinated  cohort  is  difficult  to  ascertain  outside  of  the  clinical  trial  setting.  To  address  this challenge,  we  used  propensity  matching  to  generate  cohorts  of  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated patients who are balanced for demographic, geographic, and social variables, and then evaluated the  effect  of  vaccination  on  the  rate  of  SARS-CoV-2  positivityand  COVID-19  severity  between these  cohorts.  These  vaccines,  when  administered  as  two  serial  doses,  were  88.7%  effective (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least 36 days after the first dose. This result is in line with the previously reported efficacies for both BNT162b2 (95.0%; 95% CI: 90.3-97.6%) and mRNA-1273 (94.1%; 95% CI: 89.3-96.8%) in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 with onset at least 28 or 42 days after the first dose, respectively (9, 10). That  the  efficacy  observed  in  our  study  is  slightly  lower  than  those  reported  in  the  two corresponding randomized controlled trials should be interpreted cautiously and contextually, as there are several plausible reasons for this. First, the 95% confidence intervals of all three efficacy estimates  are  highly  overlapping,  consistent  with  the  true  efficacies  not  being  meaningfully different from each other. Second, dueto distribution guidelines that are in place for Phase 1a of the vaccine rollout (11), individuals at high risk for acquiring COVID-19 (e.g., healthcare workers and residents of long term care facilities) are expected to be overrepresented in this vaccinated cohort.  This  could  lead  to  an  underestimation  of  vaccine  efficacy,  as  the  propensity  matched unvaccinated  group  is  likely  composed  of  lower-risk  individuals  despite  being  matched  for  age, sex,  race,  ethnicity,  and  the  number  of  prior  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  tests.  Third,  the  likelihood  of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may be dependent on vaccination status to a greater extent in the real world than it is in the context of a randomized trial. For example, vaccinated individuals may feel more comfortable participating in social situations that pose a higher risk for infection, whereas this bias did not exist by definition in the context of the observer-blinded clinical trials. On the other hand,  vaccinated  individuals  may  be  more  inclined  to  take  precautionary  measures  such  as wearing masks and washing hands frequently in order to reduce their risk of infection, which could result in the “healthy user bias” (23). Follow-up observational studies are required to assess the associations between COVID-19 vaccination and health-seeking behaviors such as adherence to COVID-19 social distancing guidelines.The  incidence  rates  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  in  both  our  vaccinatedand  unvaccinated cohorts  (113  and  292  cases  per  1000  person-years,  respectively)  are  notably  higher  than  the COVID-19 incidence rates reported in the placebo groups of both the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 trials  (69.1  and  79.7  cases  per  1000  person-years,  respectively),  but  there  are  also  several explanations for this observation. First and most importantly, in contrast to both clinical trials, our outcome of interest is only a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (with no requirement for presence of any clinical symptoms), whereas the phase 3 trials were designed to study symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Given that over 40% of COVID-19 cases may be asymptomatic (24, 25), we know  .

9that  the  rates  of  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  positivity  would  have  been  higher  than  the  rates  of symptomatic  COVID-19  in  both  trials.  This  discrepancy  in  measured  outcomes  may  also contribute  to  the  slight  differences  in  estimated  efficacy  addressedpreviously.  Second,  due  to overrepresentation  of  high-risk  individuals  in  the  vaccinated  cohort  as  described  above,  it  is reasonable to hypothesize that the infection incidence was positively skewed in this study. Another  interesting  result  from  this  study  is  the  trend  in  vaccine  efficacy  over  time.  We observe  that  the  estimated  efficacy  for  Days  1-7  is  53.6%  (95%  CI:  [40.9%,  63.8%]),  while  the estimated efficacy for Days 8-14 is 46.7% (95% CI: [31.1%, 58.9%]). One explanation could be that some individuals who initially presented with symptoms for COVID-19 were filtered out from the vaccinated cohort.  This could explain the low rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in the first week following the first vaccine dose. As a result, we should use caution when interpreting the results from the time periods “Days 1-7” and “Days 1 onwards” in this study.   Our finding that hospitalization rates are lower in COVID-19 patients who were vaccinated prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to propensity matched unvaccinated COVID-19 patients is consistent with the clinical trial results for both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 (9, 10). In the trial of BNT162b2, 9 casesof severe COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group compared to only one in the vaccinated cohort; and in the trial of mRNA-1273, 30 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred, all  of  which  were  in  the  placebo  group.  While  the  ICU  admission  and  mortality  rates  were  not significantly lower in our vaccinated population, this may be attributable to an inadequate number of  patients  with  these  outcomes  in  either  group  to  date  in  our  study.  As  more  patients  are vaccinated  and  follow-up  time  increases,  we  will  update  our  analyses  to  determine  whether vaccination can also reduce the risk of these outcomes.There are several important limitations to consider in this study. First, while the cohort size was even larger than the cohorts studied in phase 3 trials, the mean follow-up time per patient is substantially lower (mean = 27.1 days versus approximately 80 to 90 days). Consistent with this, approximately 45.1% of our vaccinated cohort had received only one dose of vaccination at the time of this study (Table S1). We were thuslimited in the number of patients and at-risk person-days that were available for the critical long term efficacy analyses. Second, we did not assess vaccine-associated adverse events, nor did we compare the clinical symptomatology of COVID-19  infections between  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  patients.  Third,  it  is  possible  that  the likelihood  of  seeking  out  a  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  test  was  different  between  vaccinated  and propensity  matched  unvaccinated  patients,  which  could  introduce  bias  into  our  estimates  of vaccine  efficacy.  Indeed,  vaccinated  patients  may  feel  less  compelled  to  undergo  subsequent PCR testing, thereby reducing the number of positive tests recorded in this group. However, our data  suggests  that  this  is  likely  not  a  strong  confounding  factor,  as  the  fraction  of  vaccinated patients with at least one PCR test after study enrollment (13.9%) was only marginally lower than the same fraction of unvaccinated patients (16.6%) (Table S1), and the cumulative counts of PCR tests are similar over time for the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts (Figure S3). Finally, the cohorts  utilized  to  assess  vaccine  efficacy  were  predominantly  female  (vaccinated:  62.2%; unvaccinated: 64.8%). As vaccine distribution expands in the coming months, we will be able to analyze cohorts which are more balanced for sex and to robustly assess vaccine efficacy in males and females separately.  .

10Our data demonstrates a strong real world effect of COVID-19 vaccination on par with the results  reported  in  each  randomized  trial.  This  study also  provides  additional  information  which could not be ascertained from either trial, including the conclusions that (1) vaccination is effective in individuals who are at highest risk for acquiring COVID-19, and (2) vaccination reduces the rate of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  as  defined  by  a  positive  PCR  test  alone.  In  summary,  we  emphasize that COVID-19 vaccines should be administered as broadly and rapidly as possible to the public and that the real world efficacy of these vaccines should be continuously monitored as we move beyond Phase 1a of the distribution process","Recent phase 3 trials have led to the authorization of two COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, and other vaccines have been approved in other countries or show promise for approval in  the  near  future  (7, 8).

First, while the cohort size was even larger than the cohorts studied in phase 3 trials, the mean follow-up time per patient is substantially lower (mean = 27.1 days versus approximately 80 to 90 days). Consistent with this, approximately 45.1% of our vaccinated cohort had received only one dose of vaccination at the time of this study (Table S1). We were thuslimited in the number of patients and at-risk person-days that were available for the critical long term efficacy analyses. Second, we did not assess vaccine-associated adverse events, nor did we compare the clinical symptomatology of COVID-19  infections between  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  patients.  Third,  it  is  possible  that  the likelihood  of  seeking  out  a  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  test  was  different  between  vaccinated  and propensity  matched  unvaccinated  patients,  which  could  introduce  bias  into  our  estimates  of vaccine  efficacy.  Indeed,  vaccinated  patients  may  feel  less  compelled  to  undergo  subsequent PCR testing, thereby reducing the number of positive tests recorded in this group. However, our data  suggests  that  this  is  likely  not  a  strong  confounding  factor,  as  the  fraction  of  vaccinated patients with at least one PCR test after study enrollment (13.9%) was only marginally lower than the same fraction of unvaccinated patients (16.6%) (Table S1), and the cumulative counts of PCR tests are similar over time for the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts (Figure S3). Finally, the cohorts  utilized  to  assess  vaccine  efficacy  were  predominantly  female  (vaccinated:  62.2%; unvaccinated: 64.8%). As vaccine distribution expands in the coming months, we will be able to analyze cohorts which are more balanced for sex and to robustly assess vaccine efficacy in males and females separately.  .

10Our data demonstrates a strong real world effect of COVID-19 vaccination on par with the results  reported  in  each  randomized  trial.  This  study also  provides  additional  information  which could not be ascertained from either trial, including the conclusions that (1) vaccination is effective in individuals who are at highest risk for acquiring COVID-19, and (2) vaccination reduces the rate of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  as  defined  by  a  positive  PCR  test  alone.  In  summary,  we  emphasize that COVID-19 vaccines should be administered as broadly and rapidly as possible to the public and that the real world efficacy of these vaccines should be continuously monitored as we move beyond Phase 1a of the distribution process.","Large Phase 3 clinical trials of the two FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), have demonstrated efficacies of 94.1% (n  =  30,420,  95%  CI:  89.3-96.8)  and  95%  (n  =  43,448,  95%  CI:  90.3-97.6)  in  preventing symptomatic  COVID-19,  respectively.  Given  the  ongoing  vaccine  rollout  to  healthcare personnel  and  residents  of  long-term  care  facilities,  here  we  provide  a  preliminary assessment of real-world vaccination efficacy in 62,138 individuals from the Mayo Clinic and associated health system (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin) between December 1st2020  and  February  8th2021.  Our  retrospective  analysis  contrasts  31,069  individuals receiving at least one dose of either vaccine with 31,069 unvaccinated individuals whoare propensity-matched  based  on  demographics,  location  (zip  code),  and  number  of  prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. 8,041 individuals received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine and were  at  risk  for  infection  at  least  36  days  after  their  first  dose.    Administrationof  two COVID-19 vaccine doses was 88.7% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%)  with  onset  at  least  36  days  after  the  first  dose.  Furthermore,  vaccinated patients who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 had significantly lower 14-day hospital admission rates than propensity-matched unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relative Risk: 0.4; p-value: 0.007). Building upon the previous randomized trials of these vaccines, this study demonstrates their real-world effectiveness in reducing the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity among individuals at highest risk for infection."
"Pre-existing conditions are associated with COVID patients’ hospitalization, despite confirmed clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus","The current diagnostic gold-standard for SARS-CoV-2 clearance from infected patients is two consecutive negative PCR test results. However, there are anecdotal reports of hospitalization from  protracted  COVID  complications  despite  such  confirmed  viral  clearance,  presenting  a clinical conundrum. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 266 COVID patients to compare those  that  were  admitted/re-admitted  post-viral  clearance  (hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=93) with those that were hospitalized pre-clearance but were not re-admitted post-viral clearance (non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=173). In order to differentiate these two cohorts, we used neural network models for the augmented curation of comorbidities and complications with positive sentiment in the EHR physician notes. In the year preceding COVID onset, acute kidney injury  (n=15  (16.1%),  p-value:  0.03),  anemia  (n=20  (21.5%),  p-value:  0.02),  and  cardiac arrhythmia (n=21 (22.6%), p-value: 0.05) were significantly enriched in the physician notes of the hospitalized post-clearance cohort.  This  study  highlights  that  these  specific  pre-existing conditions  are  associated  with  amplified  hospitalization  risk  in  COVID  patients,  despite  their successful SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance. Our finding that pre-COVID anemia amplifies risk of post-COVID  hospitalization  is  particularly  concerning  given  the  high  prevalence  and  endemic nature of anemia in many low-and middle-income countries (per the World Bank definition; e.g. India,  Brazil),  which  are  unfortunately  also  seeing  high  rates  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  and COVID-induced mortality. This study motivates follow-up prospective research into the specific risk factors we have identified that appear to predispose some patients towards the after effects of COVID-19.Article summary–Strengths and limitations of this study●This  is  the  first  study  at  a  major  healthcare  center  analyzing  risk  factors  for  post-viral clearance hospitalization of COVID-19 patients.  ●This  analysis  uses  augmented  curation  methods  to  identify  complications  and comorbidities from the physician notes, rather than relying upon ICD codes. .

2●The  statistical  analysis  identifies  specific  comorbidities  in  the  year  preceding  PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 which are associated with increased rates of post-viral clearance hospitalization.●The dataset used for this study is limited to a single healthcare system, so the underlying clinical  characteristics  of  the  study  population  are  biased  to  reflect  the  clinical characteristics of individuals that receive medical treatment in certain regions of the United States (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota).  ●In this study, we use the first of two consecutive negative PCR tests to estimate the viral clearance date for each patient, however the true viral clearance date for each patient is unknown.IntroductionTo date, 42.1 millionpeople worldwide have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 with over 1 million  deaths  as  of  October  20201.  Although  many  patients  survived  the  disease,  there  is increasing attention to the possibility of symptom development and hospitalization among patients who have previously “cleared” the virus, as indicated by 2+ consecutive negative PCR test results. Data on the long-term outcomes among cleared SARS-CoV-2 patients has been thus far limited and often poorly defined. Some patients labeled as cleared have been shown to have a new positive test after documented negative tests, a positive test after a period of quarantine, or develop new symptoms requiring hospitalization after documented negative tests2–6. The former case is most narrowly suggestive of delayed viral shedding, false positives, or re-infection while the latter case allows  for  a  more  broader  interpretation  of possible  outcomes  after  clearance  to  also  include delayed complications of the index hospitalization and manifestations of a systemic inflammatory response7. Here, we will refer to clearance as patients with a history of confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and two subsequent consecutive negative PCR tests based on nasopharyngeal swabs.A recent case series8reported four patients with apparent SARS-CoV-2 reinfection after an index hospitalization, despite resolution of symptoms and radiographic abnormalities and two consecutive negative tests separated bya day. A single center cohort study of 414 patients with SARS-CoV-2 reported a reinfection rate of 16.7% among cleared patients5, while a second cohort study  of  262  patients  with  SARS-CoV-2  reported  areinfection  rate  of  14.5%  among  cleared patients4. To date, details on the outcomes of patients who require hospitalization after documented clearance of SARS-CoV-2, however, remain unknown. These hospitalizations can have enormous implications beyond individual outcomes in shaping how we guide our public health strategy, allocate healthcare resources, and identify those at greatest risk.The objective of this study is to characterize the cohort of COVID-19 patients who are admitted or readmitted to the hospital for post-clearance of the virus (Figure 1).  Here, we define the clearance date of the virus as the first of 2+ consecutive negative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection.  We compared this cohort of patients against COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized  .

3pre-clearance of the virus, but not post-clearance. We then used augmented curation to compare rates  of  COVID-19  associated  complications  in  these  two  cohorts  over  the  following  time horizons:  (1)Pre-COVID:Day -365 to Day -11 relative to the first positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, (2) SARS-CoV-2 positive:Day -10  relative  to  the  first  positive  PCR  test  up  to  the estimated  viral  clearance  date,  and (3) Post viral clearance:Day  1  to  Day  90  relative  to  the estimated viral clearance date.  In particular, we considered the following complications: anemia, cardiac arrhythmias, pleural effusion, hypertension, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury, heart failure, hyperglycemia, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure. We ran statistical significance tests to identify complications which are enriched in the hospitalized post-clearance cohort across the three time periods.  Finally, we explored the temporal distribution of phenotype occurrences in the clinical notes for both cohorts over the time window +/-90 days relative to the clearance date of the virus.

No patients were involved in the design of the study, but physicians from the Mayo Clinic who are involved with the COVID research taskforce and the clinical care for COVID patients were involved with the study design and execution.  Study designOf  22,223  patients  with  at  least  one  positive  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  test,  1,355  had  two documented negative tests following their last positive test result with an estimated viral clearance date (date of the first negative test) more than 90 days prior to the date of this analysis (October 27, 2020). Among these 1,355 patients, 266 patients were admitted to the hospital, and 93 patients were admitted or readmitted to the hospital following the estimated viral clearance date.   We define the hospitalized post-clearance cohort to consist of these 93 patients.  We note that this cohort does not include patients who simply remained in the hospital following their estimated clearance date.  On the other hand, 173 patients were admitted to the hospital pre-clearance, but .

4were not admitted or readmitted to the hospital following the estimated clearance date.  We refer to this group of 173 patients as the non-hospitalized post-clearancecohort.  In Figure 1, we provide a schematic of the study design and the key findings from this study. In Table 1, we provide the general clinical characteristics for the two cohorts, including:●Demographics:age, gender, race, ethnicity●Hospitalization status COVID Pre-clearance:whether or not the patient was admitted to the hospital during the index COVID-19 infection,●Relative Clearance Date: Number of days between first positive PCR test and first of two negative PCR tests.●Comorbidities: Anemia,  Asthma,  Cancer,  Chronic  Kidney  Disease  (CKD), Hyperglycemia, Hypertension, Obesity, Obstructive sleep apnea, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Augmented curation of clinical notesA  BERT-based  neural  network10was  applied  to  identify  phenotypes  of  interest  in  the clinical  notes  of  the  study  population.    The  model  was  previously  developed  to  classify  the sentiment of general phenotypes11and thrombotic event phenotypes12in the encounter notes of COVID-19  patients.    The  categories  of  this  classification  model  include:  Yes  (confirmed diagnosis), No (ruled out diagnosis), Maybe (possibility of disease), and Other (alternate context, e.g. family history of disease).  This model was trained using nearly 250 different phenotypes and 18,500  sentences  and  achieves  93.6%  overall  accuracy  and  over  95%  precision  and  recall  for Yes/No sentiment classification11.  For this study, the phenotypes of interest included all of the following comorbidities and complications along with their synonyms:●Comorbidities: Anemia,  Asthma,  Cancer,  Chronic  Kidney  Disease  (CKD), Hyperglycemia, Hypertension, Obesity, Obstructive sleep apnea, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).●Complications:Acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury (ARDS / ALI), Acute  kidney  injury  (AKI),  Cardiac  arrest,  Cardiac  arrhythmias,  Disseminated intravascular  coagulation  (DIC),  Heart  failure,  Myocardial  infarction,  Pleural  effusion, Pulmonary embolism, Respiratory failure, Sepsis, Septic shock, Stroke / Cerebrovascular incident, Venous thromboembolism / deep vein thrombosis (VTE / DVT).We ran the model to classify the sentiment for all of the above phenotypes in all of the clinical  notes  for  each  patient  in  the  time  periods  considered  in  this  study.    Only  sentences containing a phenotype with a positive sentiment (labeled “Yes” by the model) with a confidence of 0.95 or above were deemed positive mentions.  Repeated sentences for the same patient are ignored.  For the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase and post-viral clearance phase, we only consider the presence or absenceof a positive sentiment.  For the pre-COVID time window, we consider thresholds of 1, 2, and 3 as the minimum number of positive mentions. .

5SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG tests conducted by Mayo Clinic hospitals and health systemIn the context of PCR testing, patients seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN were tested by either a laboratory-developed test or the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay13,14. Patients seen at Mayo Clinic’s Florida hospitalsand Arizona hospitals were tested using the Roche cobas test and Abbott diagnostic test respectively15. These SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests amplify different segments of the viral genome but are considered largely equivalent from the perspective of their analytical performance. The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) code of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG test analyzed is 94563-4 (https://loinc.org/94563-4/)16. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 IgG test, patient serum samples were tested by Euroimmun Inc. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Lubeck, Germany) according to the manufacturer instructions and as described previously on the Agility  automated  ELISA  analyzer  (Dynex  Technologies,  Inc.,  Chantilly,  VA)17.  This  is  a qualitative  ELISA  for  detection  of  IgG-class  antibodies  against  a  recombinant  version  of  the SARS-CoV-2  spike  subunit  1  (S1)  protein  and  hasreceived  Food  and  Drug  Administration Emergency Use Authorization.Statistical significance testsFisher  exact  tests  were  applied  pairwise  across  each  of  the  covariates  of  interest  in comparing each cohort to its respective control group, generating both a p-value and an Odds Ratio. This test was applied using the SciPy package18in Python. p-values generated in this hypothesis were corrected using a Benjamini-Hochberg correction.ResultsCOVID patients hospitalized post-viral clearance have higher rates of pre-COVID acute kidney injury, anemia, and cardiac arrhythmias as underlying conditionsIn order to understand the patient characteristics that differentiated the ‘hospitalized post-clearance’ and ‘non-hospitalized post-clearance’ groups, we compared the clinical covariates in both the groups by analyzingphenotypes recorded with a positive sentiment in the patient history of both groups. In Table 2, we present the incidence of phenotypes which are enriched in the clinical notes during the pre-COVID time period, considering 1, 2, and 3 as the thresholds for distinct positive mentions.  When the threshold is 1, we count all of the patients even with a single positive mention of the phenotype, and as the threshold increases, this criterionbecomes more stringent and there is a monotonic decline. We observe that with a thresholdof 1 distinct positive mention, acute kidney injury (AKI) is enriched in the hospitalized post-clearance cohort (n: 15 (16.1%), relative risk: 4, 95% C.I.: [1.7, 8.8], p-value: 0.03).  This suggests that patients with even a single positive mention of AKImay  .

6be at higher risk of poorer long-term prognosis, such as hospitalization post-clearance of the virus. In addition, with a threshold of 3 distinct positive mentions, the hospitalized post-clearance cohort is enriched for anemia (n: 20 (21.5%), relativerisk: 3.1, 95% C.I.: [1.6, 5.9], p-value: 0.02) and cardiac arrhythmias (n: 21 (22.6%), relative risk: 2.3, 95% C.I.: [1.3, 4.1], p-value: 0.05). The fact that these phenotypes require more mentions to differentiate the two cohorts motivates the need to investigate whether these incidents are chronic or recurring, andhow that may be linked with increased risk of post-clearance hospitalization.In Figure 2, we present the temporal distribution of phenotypes in the clinical notes for acute kidney injury, anemia, and cardiac arrhythmias for the Pre-COVID time period.  We observe that both cohorts have higher rates of reports for all three phenotypes in the time period of -50 days to -10 days relative to the first positive PCR testing date.  In addition, we observe that acute kidney injury is reported more frequently in the clinical notes from -200 days to -280 days relative to the first positive PCR testing date. These clusters of notes may reflect groups of patients who were admitted to the hospital with these phenotypes around the same time.  In Supplementary Table S1, we present the enrichment results for all of the pre-existing conditions that we considered, including those which are not significantly differentiated. Post-clearance  of  SARS-CoV-2  virus, COVID  patients  experience  complications  including cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, and immunological conditionsIn Table 3, we present the rates of complications for the two cohorts of interest for the two time periods following PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2: (1) SARS-CoV-2 positive phase, and (2) post-viral  clearance  phase.      For  the  post-viral  clearance  phase,  we  observe  the  following complications  at  higher  rates  in  the  hospitalized  post-clearance  cohort:  acute  kidney  injury, anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, hyperglycemia,  hypertension,  pleural  effusion,  respiratory  failure,  sepsis,  and  venous thromboembolism  /  deep  vein  thrombosis.    Among  these,  the  most  significantly  enriched phenotypes are: pleural effusion (relative risk: 4.2, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 7.9], p-value: 1.2E-4), cardiac arrhythmias (relative risk: 5.3, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 12], p-value: 9.3E-4), and hyperglycemia (relative risk: Infinity, 95% C.I.: [1.8, 5,400], p-value: 1.0E-3).In Figure 3, we show rates of these phenotypes over the +/-90 time window centered around the estimated viral clearance date for each patient.  For most of these complications, we observe for the case cohort that the majority of reports in the clinical notes occur within the first three weeks following the estimated viral clearance date.  An exception is for pleural effusions, which occurs relatively frequently in the notes of the case cohort in the two months following the clearance date.  In addition, we observe moderate amounts of reports for cardiac arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury, hypertension, and venous thromboembolism / deep vein thrombosis around 50 to 70 days post-clearance.  .

7DiscussionThe topic of hospitalization and readmission in COVID-19 patients has been under major focus  for  mitigating  national  healthcare  costs,  particularly  among  30-day  readmissions  that account  for  $17  billion  in  avoidable  Medicare  expenditures19.  Prior  studies  have  investigated hospitalization and readmission after recovery from other acute illnesses, such as influenza and community-acquired  pneumonia,  heart  failure,  and  decompensated cirrhosis.  In  the  case  of influenza, the most common cause of short-term re-admission is due to non-influenza pneumonia, thought  to  result  from  complex  interactions  between  the  recovering  host  immune  system  and inflammatory response, reminiscent to a limited extent of the systemic inflammatory response seen in SARS-CoV-2. These outcomes are associated with notably higher costs of care and increased mortality20. Given the widespread prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, similar outcomes warrant detailed studies in patients hospitalized after SARS-CoV-2 clearance.In  this  study,  we  found  that  patients  hospitalized  after  SARS-CoV-2  clearance  had significantly  higher  odds  of  having  comorbidities  of  anemia  as  well  as  experiencing  serious complications of ARDS/ALI, AKI, pleural effusion, and sepsis compared to hospitalized controls. Approximately a quarter (24.5%) of these patients required ICU admission. In addition, we found that hypertension, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, and diabetes were not increased among patients hospitalized after clearance compared to controls. These are co-morbidities that have been previously well-described to be associated with poorer outcomes during an index SARS-CoV-2 infection21. One possible hypothesis for these findings is that many of these hospitalizations post-clearance were not due to re-infection per se, but rather secondary to a systemic inflammatory response, resulting in the observed increased frequency of ARDS and sepsis noted in the cases, for which patients with a higher frailty index may be more susceptible. Patients hospitalized after clearance had increased odds of having anemia compared to their respective controls. It has been well-studied that patients with anemia, independent of other health conditions, are at higher risk of frailty and mortality, particularly in older patients22. Additionally, a limitation of our study is that our algorithm did not include all forms of obstructive airway disease, including COPD, which has been indicated to increase mortality in COVID-1923. Despite these caveats, our finding that pre-COVID anemia is endemic or highly prevalent in several low-and middle-income countries23, where  COVID-19  is  unfortunately  a  raging  pandemic  (e.g.  India  and  Brazil)  is  especially concerning  from  the  standpoint  of  higher  post-viral  clearancehospitalization  risk  in  COVID patients.A point of interest in explaining heterogeneous outcomes as regards hospital admission following SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is the development of IgG antibodies post-clearance. In the context of this study 16 of 23 patients (69.5%) in the hospitalized post-clearance cohorttested for IgG antibodies test positive; this is compared to a rate of 19 of 23 patients (82.6%) in the non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort. The difference between these groups (16/23 vs. 19/23;fisher exact p-value 0.49) is not significant in this case. However, as the antibody testing data increases  .

8further investigation into the relationship between IgG seropositivity and complications following SARS-CoV-2 clearance may be warranted.There areseveral limitations of this study due to the observational nature of the data.  First, we are not controlling for PCR testing frequency, so the study population which receives access to multiple PCR tests to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection clearance may not be representative of COVID-19  patient  population  in  general.  In  addition,  the  phenotypes  of  complications  and comorbidities  which  are  identified  in  the  notes  with  positive  sentiment  may      In  addition,  the control groups for the hospitalized post-clearance cohorts were not propensity matched due to limited cohort size. However, patients in the hospitalized cohort did not differ in demographic characteristics, and compared to prior investigations on this subject, the size of our cohort is a strength of the study. Next, the current time points chosen to align the patient journeys are anchored by the first positive PCR test and the first of the two or more negative tests. Aligned the patient journeys based on their hospitalization events can help identify the conditions that are enriched with each hospitalization event. Finally, there is a limitation of the augmented curation model which is used to identify complications and comorbidities, because it only determines whether or not the phenotype was mentioned withpositive sentiment in a clinical note, and does not take into account  the  temporal  component.  Therefore,  although  we  know  that  certain  phenotypes  are enriched in the cohorts which are admitted to the hospital/ICU post-clearance, the dates of these complications are uncertain. There is research ongoing to develop natural language processing (NLP)  based  neural  network  models  which  can  differentiate  effectively  between  active  and historical phenotype diagnoses, which could strengthen these conclusions for future analyses.The phenotypes described here relate to EHR based mentions of conditions. Future work would include a complementary analysis based on lab tests relevant to the identified phenotypes such as estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, BloodUrea Nitrogen test, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Alanine transaminase (ALT), Aspartate transaminase (AST) and Bilirubin.  A longitudinal analysis integrating  clinical  notes-based  augmented  curation  and  lab-measurements  will  be  useful  in formulating a case definition of long-term COVID-19 (long-COVID). Overall, our finding of the long-term  adverse  effects  of  COVID-19  motivates  the  need  to  understand  the  biological  and mechanistic underpinning of the SARS-CoV-2 driven long-term adverse effects in order to find appropriate prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Finally, this study also emphasizes the need for detailed curation of structured and unstructured clinical data to better understand the dynamics of viral clearance, underlying conditions, and long-termcomplications.","The topic of hospitalization and readmission in COVID-19 patients has been under major focus  for  mitigating  national  healthcare  costs,  particularly  among  30-day  readmissions  that account  for  $17  billion  in  avoidable  Medicare  expenditures19.

Given the widespread prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, similar outcomes warrant detailed studies in patients hospitalized after SARS-CoV-2 clearance.In  this  study,  we  found  that  patients  hospitalized  after  SARS-CoV-2  clearance  had significantly  higher  odds  of  having  comorbidities  of  anemia  as  well  as  experiencing  serious complications of ARDS/ALI, AKI, pleural effusion, and sepsis compared to hospitalized controls. Approximately a quarter (24.5%) of these patients required ICU admission. In addition, we found that hypertension, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, and diabetes were not increased among patients hospitalized after clearance compared to controls. These are co-morbidities that have been previously well-described to be associated with poorer outcomes during an index SARS-CoV-2 infection21. One possible hypothesis for these findings is that many of these hospitalizations post-clearance were not due to re-infection per se, but rather secondary to a systemic inflammatory response, resulting in the observed increased frequency of ARDS and sepsis noted in the cases, for which patients with a higher frailty index may be more susceptible. Patients hospitalized after clearance had increased odds of having anemia compared to their respective controls. It has been well-studied that patients with anemia, independent of other health conditions, are at higher risk of frailty and mortality, particularly in older patients22. Additionally, a limitation of our study is that our algorithm did not include all forms of obstructive airway disease, including COPD, which has been indicated to increase mortality in COVID-1923. Despite these caveats, our finding that pre-COVID anemia is endemic or highly prevalent in several low-and middle-income countries23, where  COVID-19  is  unfortunately  a  raging  pandemic  (e.g.  India  and  Brazil)  is  especially concerning  from  the  standpoint  of  higher  post-viral  clearancehospitalization  risk  in  COVID patients.A point of interest in explaining heterogeneous outcomes as regards hospital admission following SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is the development of IgG antibodies post-clearance. In the context of this study 16 of 23 patients (69.5%) in the hospitalized post-clearance cohorttested for IgG antibodies test positive; this is compared to a rate of 19 of 23 patients (82.6%) in the non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort. The difference between these groups (16/23 vs. 19/23;fisher exact p-value 0.49) is not significant in this case. However, as the antibody testing data increases  .

8further investigation into the relationship between IgG seropositivity and complications following SARS-CoV-2 clearance may be warranted.There areseveral limitations of this study due to the observational nature of the data.  First, we are not controlling for PCR testing frequency, so the study population which receives access to multiple PCR tests to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection clearance may not be representative of COVID-19  patient  population  in  general.  In  addition,  the  phenotypes  of  complications  and comorbidities  which  are  identified  in  the  notes  with  positive  sentiment  may      In  addition,  the control groups for the hospitalized post-clearance cohorts were not propensity matched due to limited cohort size. However, patients in the hospitalized cohort did not differ in demographic characteristics, and compared to prior investigations on this subject, the size of our cohort is a strength of the study. Next, the current time points chosen to align the patient journeys are anchored by the first positive PCR test and the first of the two or more negative tests. Aligned the patient journeys based on their hospitalization events can help identify the conditions that are enriched with each hospitalization event. Finally, there is a limitation of the augmented curation model which is used to identify complications and comorbidities, because it only determines whether or not the phenotype was mentioned withpositive sentiment in a clinical note, and does not take into account  the  temporal  component.  Therefore,  although  we  know  that  certain  phenotypes  are enriched in the cohorts which are admitted to the hospital/ICU post-clearance, the dates of these complications are uncertain. There is research ongoing to develop natural language processing (NLP)  based  neural  network  models  which  can  differentiate  effectively  between  active  and historical phenotype diagnoses, which could strengthen these conclusions for future analyses.The phenotypes described here relate to EHR based mentions of conditions. Future work would include a complementary analysis based on lab tests relevant to the identified phenotypes such as estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, BloodUrea Nitrogen test, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Alanine transaminase (ALT), Aspartate transaminase (AST) and Bilirubin.  A longitudinal analysis integrating  clinical  notes-based  augmented  curation  and  lab-measurements  will  be  useful  in formulating a case definition of long-term COVID-19 (long-COVID). Overall, our finding of the long-term  adverse  effects  of  COVID-19  motivates  the  need  to  understand  the  biological  and mechanistic underpinning of the SARS-CoV-2 driven long-term adverse effects in order to find appropriate prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Finally, this study also emphasizes the need for detailed curation of structured and unstructured clinical data to better understand the dynamics of viral clearance, underlying conditions, and long-termcomplications.","The current diagnostic gold-standard for SARS-CoV-2 clearance from infected patients is two consecutive negative PCR test results. However, there are anecdotal reports of hospitalization from  protracted  COVID  complications  despite  such  confirmed  viral  clearance,  presenting  a clinical conundrum. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 266 COVID patients to compare those  that  were  admitted/re-admitted  post-viral  clearance  (hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=93) with those that were hospitalized pre-clearance but were not re-admitted post-viral clearance (non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=173). In order to differentiate these two cohorts, we used neural network models for the augmented curation of comorbidities and complications with positive sentiment in the EHR physician notes. In the year preceding COVID onset, acute kidney injury  (n=15  (16.1%),  p-value:  0.03),  anemia  (n=20  (21.5%),  p-value:  0.02),  and  cardiac arrhythmia (n=21 (22.6%), p-value: 0.05) were significantly enriched in the physician notes of the hospitalized post-clearance cohort.  This  study  highlights  that  these  specific  pre-existing conditions  are  associated  with  amplified  hospitalization  risk  in  COVID  patients,  despite  their successful SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance. Our finding that pre-COVID anemia amplifies risk of post-COVID  hospitalization  is  particularly  concerning  given  the  high  prevalence  and  endemic nature of anemia in many low-and middle-income countries (per the World Bank definition; e.g. India,  Brazil),  which  are  unfortunately  also  seeing  high  rates  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  and COVID-induced mortality. This study motivates follow-up prospective research into the specific risk factors we have identified that appear to predispose some patients towards the after effects of COVID-19."
Real-time analysis of a mass vaccination effort confirms the safety of FDA-authorized mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNtech,"As the COVID-19 vaccination campaign unfolds as one of the most rapid and widespread in history, it is important to continuously assess the real-world safety of the FDA-authorized vaccines. Curation  from  large-scale  electronic  health  records  (EHRs)  allows  for  near  real-time  safety evaluations that were not previously possible. Here, we advance context-and sentiment-aware deep neural  networks  over  the  multi-state  Mayo  Clinic  enterprise  (Minnesota,  Arizona,  Florida, Wisconsin) for automatically curating the adverse effects mentioned by healthcare providers in over 108,000 EHR clinical notes between December 1st2020 and February 8th2021. We retrospectively compared  the  clinical  notes  of  31,029  individuals  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine to those of 30,933 unvaccinated individuals who were propensity matched by demographics, residential location, and history of prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. We find that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were seen in the clinic at similar rates within 21 days of the first or second actual or assigned vaccination date (first dose Odds Ratio = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.10-1.18; second dose Odds Ratio = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96). Further, the incidence rates of all surveyed adverse effects were similar or lower in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals after either vaccine dose, although myalgia was modestly increased within 7 days of the second dose when considering only pairs of matched individuals who each had at least one clinical note in this time window (Incidence Rate Ratio = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.1-6.7). Finally, the most frequently documented adverse effects within 7 days of eachvaccine dose were fatigue (Dose 1: 1.75%, Dose 2: 1.18%), nausea (Dose 1: 1.03%, Dose 2: 0.84%), myalgia (Dose 1: 0.41%; Dose 2: 0.43%), diarrhea (Dose 1: 0.65%; Dose 2: 0.45%), arthralgia (Dose 1: 0.64%; Dose 2: 0.57%), erythema (Dose 1: 0.56%; Dose 2: 0.44%), vomiting (Dose 1: 0.44%, Dose 2: 0.29%) and fever (Dose 1: 0.21%; Dose 2: 0.18%). These frequencies of adverse event documentation in EHR notes are 2.1 times (95% CI: [1.5, 3.0]) to 1500 times (95% CI: [670, 2800]) lower than the frequencies of adverse events recorded via active solicitation  during  clinical  trials  or  post-marketing  surveillance,  with  headache  after  second vaccination showing the highest ratio of trial reporting to EHR documentation. This rapid and timely analysis of EHR notes from 31,029 vaccinated individuals highlights the rarity of vaccine-associated adverse  effects  requiring  clinical  attention  and  reaffirms  the  tolerability  of  the  FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines in practice. .

2IntroductionFollowing their Emergency Use Authorizations by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December of 2020, more than 52 million doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the United States1–3. Phase 3 trials demonstrate strong efficacy and favorable safety profiles for these vaccines in the cohorts studied. Specifically, the trials showed 95.0% (95% CI, 90.3 to 97.6) and 94.1% (95% CI, 89.3 to 96.8%)  efficacy  for BNT162b2  and  mRNA-1273  respectively.  While  self-resolving  mild  to moderate  adverse  effects  were  common  in  vaccinated  participants,  serious  adverse  effects occurred  rarely  and  with  a  frequency  comparable  to  placebo4,5.  Local  adverse  effects  of  any severity  reported  in  these  trials  included  injection  site  pain  (84.1-92%),  injection  site  swelling (10.5-70%), and injection site erythema (9.5-14.6%). Systemic effects of any severity included fatigue (62.9-70%), headache (55.1-64.7%), myalgia (38.3-61.5%), arthralgia (23.6-46.4%), chills (31.9-45.4%), fever (14.2-15.5%), and nausea/vomiting (1.1-23.0%)6,7.Consistent with CDC recommendations, early vaccination efforts (Phase 1a) in the United States have targeted healthcare workers, residents and staff at long term care facilities, who are at elevated risk for COVID-19 relative to the general public8–11. As the vaccines continue to be administered more broadly, it will be critical to continuously evaluate real world safety and efficacy data  from  all  those  who  have  received  these  vaccines.  This  approach  may  validate  existing findings or highlight differences in the larger population compared to the clinical trial experience with  respect  to  vaccine  efficacy  and  adverse  effects.  Of  note,  the  populations  undergoing vaccination may differ meaningfully from the trial populations. For example, healthcare workers and long term care residents receiving the first wave of vaccines in Phase 1a likely comprised a small fraction of the Phase 3 trial populations. Additionally, some pregnant women are receiving COVID-19  vaccines  in  the  real  world12,  while  they  were  excluded  from  both  trials4,5.    Finally, continuous monitoring will help to identify and better quantify the frequency of rare severe adverse effects such as anaphylaxis, which was widely reported but only observed in a small number of individuals after approval of both vaccines13–17.As part of the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) maintained by the FDA, V-safe has recently been established to specifically monitor the safety profiles of COVID-19 vaccines  as  they  are  administered  to  the  public18.  V-safe  is  a  voluntary  program  into  which vaccinated  individuals  can  enroll.  Once  enrolled,  participants  receive  frequent  reminders  to complete surveys which document their side effects electronically. Thus, this program will create an excellent resource of clinical trial-like safety data derived from significantly larger and more diverse patient populations than those who were enrolled in the Phase 1/2 or Phase 3 trials. An  important  complementary  approach  to  post-authorization  surveillance  of  vaccine efficacy and safety is via the real-time analysis of patient data stored in electronic health record (EHR) systems. We have previously developed and described augmented curation methods to rapidly create and compare cohorts of COVID-19 patients within a large EHR system, and have recently applied these methods to assess the real world efficacy of both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in over 31,000 individuals receiving these vaccines at the Mayo Clinic and associated health system19–23.  Here  we  expand  on  these  efforts  to  study  the  adverse  effects  experienced  by individuals and documented in the EHR after COVID-19 vaccination in the clinical environment. .

3It should be noted that the monitoring of vaccine-associated adverse effects in clinical trials or post-marketing surveillance efforts like V-safe is quite different from such monitoring in routine  clinical  practice.  In  clinical  trials,  participants  are  aware  that  they  are  receiving  an experimental product, and adverse effect reporting is encouraged or solicited. Similarly, as was previously noted, V-safe participants complete frequent surveys to document their side effects after vaccination. On the other hand, individuals receiving a COVID-19 vaccine during the mass vaccination campaign are informed of adverse effects that are likely to be experienced and can even be discouraged from seeking medical attention unless the symptom is particularly severe. Thus, adverse effects are likely to becaptured only in the EHR of individuals who experience symptoms which are severe or persistent enough to warrant a return to clinic, or who happen to have a previously scheduled routine clinical visit in the post vaccination time period. Accordingly, the intention of our analysis is not to determine whether real world data recapitulates the adverse effect frequencies reported in prior trials. Instead, it is to (1) establish the rates at which individuals actually report potential vaccine-associated adverseeffects to health care practitioners (HCPs) in several defined time intervals after vaccination, and (2) determine whether these rates of adverse effect reporting are unexpectedly high. To address the latter point, it is critical to establish the baseline frequency at which each adverse effect is expected to be documented in the clinical notes of our vaccinated cohort. We thus  built  upon  our  previous  vaccine  efficacy  analysis  which  employed  a  1-to-1  propensity matching  procedure  to  derive  a  cohort  of  unvaccinated  individuals  who  are  balanced  for demographic  factors,  residential  location,  and  history  of  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  testing  (see Methods)24. Here we curated the clinical notes of these vaccinated and matched unvaccinated individuals over several time periods to define the frequencies of various symptoms of interest. In our analyses, the propensity matched group serves a purpose similar to that of the placebo arm in clinical trial safety assessments, allowing us to contextualize and better interpret the absolute rates of adverse effects documented in the notes of vaccinated individuals. We  find  that  individuals  undergoing  COVID-19  vaccination  do  not  return  to  the  clinic, including the emergency department, at unexpectedly high rates in the 7, 14, or 21 days following either vaccine dose. Further, the rates of adverse effects (headache, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, fever, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, anaphylaxis, facial paralysis, lymphadenopathy, and erythema) documented  in  EHR  notes  over  these  time  intervals  are  generally  not  higher  in  vaccinated individuals compared to the unvaccinated control cohort. The absolute rates of adverse effect documentation in the EHR are markedly lower than the rates observed in settings of solicited reporting  (i.e.  clinical  trials,  post-marketing  surveillance).  This  study  supports  the  safety  and tolerability of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in practice, further strengthening the case for the rapid and broad distribution of vaccines tothe public.

4the Mayo Clinic Health System. This study was reviewed by the Mayo ClinicInstitutional Review Board  (IRB)  and  determined  to  be  exempt  from  the  requirement  for  IRB  approval  (45  CFR 46.104d, category 4). Subjects were excluded if they did not have a research authorization on file.The cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals eligible for inclusion in this study are  identical  to  the  cohorts  considered  in  a  previous  analysis:  “FDA-authorized  COVID-19 vaccines are effective per real-world evidence synthesized across a multi-state health system”24.  In total, there were 507,525 individuals in the Mayo electronic health record (EHR) database who received a PCR test between February 15, 2020 and February 8, 2021. To obtain the eligible study  population,  we  defined  the following  inclusion  criteria:  (1)  at  least  18  years  old;  (2)  no positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test before December 1, 2020; (3) resides in a locale (based on Zip code) with at least 25 individuals who have received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. This population included249,708  individuals,  of  whom  31,623  have  received  BNT162b2  or  mRNA-1273  and 218,085 have no record of COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccinated individuals who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR between December 1, 2020 and the date of their first vaccine dose were excluded, resulting in 31,299 individuals. Individuals with zero follow-up days after vaccination (i.e. those who received the first vaccine dose on the date of data collection) were also excluded, leaving 31,069 individuals in the final vaccinated cohort. The propensity matched unvaccinated cohort was selected from the previously derived set of 218,085 unvaccinated individuals. The purpose of this cohort was to establish the baseline frequency of EHR documentation for each adverse effect of interest in a cohort which is clinically similar to our vaccinated cohort. These baseline, or expected, frequencies can then be compared to the observed frequencies to determine whether or not these adverse effects are reported at unexpectedly high rates among patients receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. From  these  cohorts  of  31,069  vaccinated  and  propensity  matched  unvaccinated individuals, we removed individuals who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test within the first four days after their first actual or assigned vaccine dose (see below). This filtering step was done because it is known that the onset of disease associated symptoms, some of which overlap with vaccine side effects, can precede the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by PCR25. Accordingly, the cause of symptoms observed during this time period for such patients would be ambiguous, as they could reasonably stem from vaccination or infection. After this filter, there were 31,029 and 30,933 individuals in the final vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively.The  selection  algorithm  and  its  associated  counts  are  summarized  in Figure 1.  More details on the propensity score matching procedure are provided in the prior manuscript24. This includes a table showing that the 1-to-1 matched cohorts (n = 31,069 each) were indeed balanced for all covariates included in propensity score matching (standardized mean difference < 0.1 for each one) and figures illustrating the distributions of age and total follow-up time between the first vaccine dose and the end of the data collection period. Definition of time intervals for safety analysesFor each vaccinated individual, we defined the date of their first vaccine dose as Day V1and the date of their second vaccine dose as Day V2. In the Results section, these are referred  .

5to as “actual” dates of vaccination. For each unvaccinated individual, Day V1and Day V2were designated as identical to their matchedvaccinated individual. In the Results section, these are referred to as “assigned” dates of vaccination. Individuals were considered for the post-second dose analyses if they (1) were part of the initial cohorts, (2) received a second vaccine dose (vaccinated  cohort)  or  were  matched  to  an  individual  who  received  a  second  vaccine  dose (unvaccinated cohort), and (3) were not diagnosed with COVID-19 before Day V2or within the first four days after Day V2. The third criterion was applied for a similar reason as explained above for the initial cohorts: if an individual tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on or before the fourth day after the second vaccination, then any symptoms observed after the second actual or assigned vaccination date would have an ambiguous cause. Definition of adverse effects of interestThe adverse effects considered were primarily derived from those assessed in Phase III trials  of  BNT162b2  and  mRNA-12734,5,  including  fatigue,  fever,  chills,  myalgia,  arthralgia, headache, lymphadenopathy, erythema, diarrhea, vomiting, and local pain and swelling. We also included anaphylaxis and facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy), as these rare events have been reported in individuals receiving COVID-19 vaccines as well. Each adverse effect was mapped to a set of synonyms  intended  to  capture  the  most  common  ways  that  a  given  phenotype  would  be referenced in the context of a clinical note. Curation of adverse effects from clinical notesTo  curate  the  adverse  effects  experienced  by  each  patient  from  the  electronic  health record,  we  used  a  BERT-based  neural  network  model26to  classify  the  sentiment  for  the phenotypes  (described  above)  mentioned  in  the  clinical  notes.  Specifically,  this  classification model categorizes phenotype-containing sentences into one of four categories: (1) confirmed diagnosis, (2) ruled-out diagnosis, (3) possibility of disease, and (4) alternate context (e.g. family history).This classification model was trained on 18,500 sentences and has shown an out-of-sample accuracy of 93.6% with precision and recall scores above 95%25. For each individual, we applied the sentiment model to the clinical notes in the Mayo Clinic electronic health record during our defined intervals of interest for each individual: (1) Day V1to 7, 14, or 21 days after Day V1, and (3) Day V2to 7, 14, or 21 days after Day V2. For each phenotype, we identified the first date on which the given individual had at least one sentence in which the phenotype was categorized as “confirmed diagnosis” with a confidence score of at least 90%. For the severe phenotype anaphylaxis, each such sentence was manually reviewed to verify the positive sentiment (i.e. confirmed  diagnosis)  and  to  assess  the  tense  of  this  sentiment  (i.e.  past  vs.  present).  Only sentences which confirm a present diagnosis were used to count anaphylaxis events in this study. Evaluating rates ofreturn to clinic after vaccinationTo  evaluate  the  likelihood  of  returning  to  the  clinic  after  vaccination,  we  counted  the number of individuals who had at least one clinical note in the 7, 14, and 21 days after Day V1and Day V2. The fraction of individuals with clinical follow-up was calculated as the number of individuals with at least clinical note in the time window divided by the total number of individuals in each group. The difference in clinical follow-up rates was assessed by calculating the odds  .

6ratio (OR) along with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The null hypothesis was that the OR falls between 0.91 and 1.1, inclusive (i.e. the larger rate is at most 10% larger than the smaller rate); thus, an OR was considered significant if the upper bound of the 95% CI was less than 0.91 or the lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than 1.1. To  evaluate  emergent  clinical  follow-up,  we  compared  the  number  and  percentage  of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals who contributed at least oneEmergency Department (ED) note in the 1, 7, 14, or 21 days after each actual or assigned vaccine administration date. The odds ratio and corresponding 95% CI was calculated for each time window, with the null hypothesis  stating  that  the  OR  falls  between  0.91  and  1.1,  inclusive  (as  above).  We  also determined the total number of ED notes from vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in these same time windows, along with the fraction of ED notes relative to all clinical notes. The difference in the fraction of ED notes was assessed by computing an odds ratio and corresponding 95% CI, with  the  null  hypothesis  stating  that  the  OR  falls  between  0.91  and  1.1,  inclusive.  ED  notes included those under the following categories in the EHR system: ED Notes, ED Procedure Note, ED Provider Notes, ED Provider Triage Note, ED Re-evaluation Note, and ED Triage Notes. All odds  ratios  and  95%  confidence  intervals  were  calculated  using  the  fisher.test  function  in  R version 4.0.327.Evaluating vaccine adverse effects among the total cohortsTo evaluate adverse effects associated with receiving a COVID-19 vaccine in the clinical setting, we compared the two populations described above and summarized in Figure 1: (1) 31,029 individuals with follow-up who received BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 and did not have a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test prior to vaccination (“vaccinated”), and (2) 30,933  propensity matched individuals who have never received a COVID-19 vaccine and did not have a positive SARS-CoV-2  PCR  test  before  the  first  vaccination  date  of  theirmatched  individual (“unvaccinated”).  The  association  of  a  given  adverse  effect  to  vaccination  status  was  assessed  by computing  the  incidence  rate  ratio  (IRR)  of  the  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  cohorts  during several defined time intervals. Specifically,we evaluated adverse effects which were documented in clinical notes within 7, 14, or 21 days of receiving the first vaccine dose (Day V1to 7, 14, or 21 days after Day V1) or the second vaccine dose (Day V2to 7, 14, or 21 days after Day V2). For each cohort in a defined time period, incidence rates were calculated as the number of individuals experiencing the given adverse effect in that time period divided by the total number of at risk person-days contributed in that time period. For each individual, at-risk person-days are defined as the number of days from the start of the time period until the day on which the individual experienced the adverse effect or died, or four days prior to testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. The IRR was calculated as the incidence rate of the vaccinated cohort divided by the incidence rate of the unvaccinated cohort, and its 95% CI was computed using an exact approach described previously28. The IRR was considered to be statistically significant if the 95% CI did not include 1. Comparison of adverse effect rates per EHR versus clinical trial and V-safe reporting We aimed to compare the percentage of patients with an EHR-documented occurrence of each adverse event to the percentage of patients who reported the corresponding adverse event  .

7in the Phase 3 trials of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, and in V-safe (a voluntary and active post-marketing  surveillance  effort  to  assess  the  safety  of  COVID-19  vaccines)4,5.  To  do  so,  we extracted the number of patients reporting each adverse effect (of any severity level) within 7 days of the first or second vaccine doses from the clinical trial Solicited Safety Set (mRNA-1273; NDose 1= 14,808, NDose 2= 14,733)  or Reactogenicity Subset (BNT162b2; NDose 1= 4,093, NDose 2= 3,758).  We  also  extracted  the  percentage  of  patients  reporting  each  adverse  effect  through January 14, 2021 in response to daily text message-based health screenings as part of V-safe for the week following each dose of vaccination29. We compared these clinical trial and post-marketing surveillance adverse effect reporting rates to the rates of EHR-documented adverse effects  within  7  days  of  the  first  or  second  doses.  Reporting-to-Documentation  ratios  were calculated for each adverse effect in each time interval by dividing the 7 day reporting rate in the given clinical trial (or V-safe) by the 7 day EHR documentation rate in our cohort. 95% confidence intervals around these ratios were computed with a standard delta-method-based approach30. Evaluating vaccine adverse effects in individuals who returned to clinicBecause  only  a  fraction  of  individuals  in  the  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  cohorts contributed clinical notes during the defined intervals after their actual or assigned vaccination dates, we also assessed the rates of adverse effects documented in the EHR specifically among the individuals who had returned to clinic. To select the cohorts for this analysis, we considered any pair of matched vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals who both contributed at least one clinical note which contained at least one phenotype term in the 7, 14, or 21 days after the actual or assigned date of first or second vaccination. The number of such matched pairs in each time interval is provided in Table S1. For each time interval, we then computed incidence rates for each adverse effect in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, along with the incidence rate ratios and 95% CI as described above. The IRR was considered to be statistically significant if the 95% CI did not include 1.ResultsVaccinated individuals do not return to the clinic or emergency department at unexpectedly high rates after either vaccine doseTo assess rates of clinical follow-up after study enrollment, we compared the number of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with EHR notes within 7, 14, or 21 days of each actual or  assigned  vaccination  date.  In  the  7  days  after  the  first  vaccine  dose, 6,081of  the 31,029 (19.6%) vaccinated individuals had at least one EHR note, compared to 5,653 of 30,933(18.3%) unvaccinated individuals (Odds Ratio = 1.09; 95% CI: [1.05-1.13]) (Table 1). This difference was not considered significant as the lower bound of the 95% CI was less than 1.1 (see Methods). The rates of return to clinic were also similar between these cohorts within 14 and 21 days of the first dose (Odds Ratio14 Days= 1.13 [1.09-1.17]; Odds Ratio21 Days= 1.14 [1.10-1.18]) (Table 1).Within  7  days  of  the  second  dose, 2,496of  16,982  (14.7%)  vaccinated  individuals contributed EHR notes, compared to2,630(15.8%) of 16,623 unvaccinated individuals (Odds Ratio = 0.92 [0.86-0.97) (Table 2).

8bound of the 95% CI was greater than 0.91 (see Methods). Similarly, the rates of return to clinic were comparable between these cohorts within 14 and 21 days of the second dose (Odds Ratio14 Days= 0.90 [0.85-0.95]; Odds Ratio21 Days= 0.91 [0.86-0.96]) (Table 2). To  specifically  assess  the  rates  of  emergent  clinical  follow-up,  we  also  compared  the number of emergency department (ED) EHR notes contributed by each group. The vaccinated cohort contributed a similar or lower number of ED notes than the unvaccinated cohort in the 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after both the first and second actual or assigned vaccination dates (Tables S2-S3). Consistent with this, fewer vaccinated than unvaccinated individuals contributed at least one ED EHR note within any of these time intervals (Tables S4-S5).In summary, these findings show that individualsreceiving COVID-19 vaccines do not tend to return to the clinic, including the emergency department, in the subsequent weeks at higher-than-expected rates, which suggests favorable tolerability of these vaccines.Documented vaccine associated adverse effects in EHR notes are rare compared to the frequencies reported in clinical trialsAmong the 31,029 and 30,933 individuals in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts , the most commonly documented symptoms in the 7 days after the first vaccine dose included fatigue (542[1.75%] vaccinated individuals; 592[1.91%] unvaccinated individuals), nausea (321[1.03%]; 493[1.59%]), diarrhea (203[0.65%]; 247[0.80%]), myalgia (128[0.41%]; 123[0.40%]), arthralgia  (198[0.64%]; 168[0.54%]),  erythema  (174[0.56%]; 184[0.60%]),  vomiting  (138[0.44%]; 261[0.84%]), and fever (66[0.21%]; 124[0.40%]) (Table 3). The same events were also the most frequently documented in the 7 days following the second  vaccine  dose  (n  =  16,982  in  the  vaccinated  cohort;  n  =  16,623  for  the unvaccinated cohort):  fatigue  (200[1.17%]  vaccinated  individuals; 321[1.93%]  unvaccinated  individuals), nausea (143 [ 0.84%]; 283[1.70%]), diarrhea (76[0.45%]; 117[0.70%]), myalgia (73[0.43%]; 61[0.37%]), arthralgia (97 [0.57%]; 91[0.55%]), erythema (75[0.44%]; 89[0.54%]), vomiting (49[0.29%]; 165[0.99%]), and fever (31[0.18%]; 63[0.38%]) (Table 4).Notably, these rates of adverse effects documented in EHR notes were markedly lower than the rates of adverse effects observed in clinical trialsand those currently captured in V-safe 18,29,31,32. Specifically, the rates of EHR documentation of adverse effects within 7 days of the first dose were 2.1 (95% CI: 1.5-3) to 910 (95% CI: 500-1,500) times lower than the corresponding reporting rates among the safety populations of the Phase 3 trials in the same time interval, with headache showing the largest discrepancy between these sources (Table 5). These differences were even more pronounced in the week following the second vaccine dose, during which EHR documentation rates were 4.9 (95% CI: 3.3-7.2) to 1,500 (95% CI: 670-2,800) times lower than corresponding  reporting  rates  in  the  trials  (Table 5).  This  discrepancy  is  to  be  expected,  as individuals vaccinated outside of the trial or post-marketing surveillance setting are advised that it is normal to experience these adverse effects, and so they are less likely to report them to a healthcare provider. As such, the vaccine associatedadverse effects which are captured in EHR notes are likely to be those that are severe or persistent enough to cause an individual to return to the clinic or otherwise notify their health care provider.  .

9Adverse effects are not documented more frequently in the EHR notes of vaccinated individuals compared to those of propensity-matched unvaccinated individualsTo  test  whether  documentation  of  each  adverse  effect  was  actually  associated  with receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, we computed the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for each adverse effect between the vaccinated and propensity matched unvaccinated cohorts. Several symptoms or events including headache, myalgia, arthralgia, erythema, and anaphylaxis had similar incidence rates  during  the  7  days  after  the  firstor  second  actual  or  assigned  vaccine  dose,  with  the confidence  intervals  including  1  (Tables  3-4).  Other  symptoms  showed  significantly  lower incidence rates in the 7 days after both doses in the vaccinated cohort, including fever (IRRdose 1= 0.53[0.39,-0.72]; IRRdose 2= 0.48 [0.30-0.74]), nausea (IRRdose 1= 0.65 [0.56-0.75]; IRRdose 2= 0.49  [0.40-0.60]),  vomiting  (IRRdose  1=  0.53  [0.42-0.65];  IRRdose  2=  0.29  [0.2-0.4]),  diarrhea (IRRdose 1=  0.82  [0.68-0.99];  IRRdose 2=  0.63  [0.47-0.85]),  fatigue (IRRdose 1= 0.91[0.81-1.0]; IRRdose 2= 0.6 [0.50-0.72]), chills (IRRdose 1= 0.61[0.42-0.88]; IRRdose 2= 0.67[0.43-1.0]), and lymphadenopathy (IRRdose 1= 0.65 [0.48-0.87]; IRRdose 2= 0.52 [0.33-0.81]). These trends of vaccinated individuals showing similar or lower incidence rates for each considered adverse effect were also true in the 14 and 21 days following actual or assigned vaccination dates (Tables S6-S9). In summary, this data supports the tolerability of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, as individuals receiving COVID-19 vaccines do not return to the clinic to report adverse effects at higher rates than propensity matched unvaccinated individuals. Among matched pairs who return to clinic, adverse effects are reported at similar rates in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohortsTo complement our previous analysis, we also considered the rates of adverse effect documentation in only the subsets of matched pairs who each contributed at least one EHR note in the 7, 14, or 21 days following the first or second actual or assigned vaccine dose. In the 7 days after the first actual or assigned vaccination date (n = 1,399 propensity matched pairs) the IRR 95%  CIs  for  most  adverse  effects  included  1  (Table 6).  Only  nausea,  vomiting  and  diarrhea showed  differences  in  incidence  rates,  with  lower  incidence  rates  in  the  vaccinated  cohort (IRRnausea= 0.59 [0.41-0.83]; IRRdiarrhea= 0.50 [0.30-0.80]; IRRvomiting= 0.59 [0.37-0.94]). (Table 6).  After  the  second  vaccination  date  (n  = 897  propensity  matched  pairs),  myalgia  was documented more frequently among vaccinated individuals (IRRmyalgia= 2.5 [1.1-6.7]), while all other  adverse  effects  were  recorded  at  similar  or  lower  rates  in  vaccinated  compared  to unvaccinated individuals(Table 7). Similarly, vaccinated individuals who returned to the clinic also showed comparable or lower incidence rates for each considered adverse effect in the 14 and 21 days post vaccination compared to their matched unvaccinated individuals who also returned to the clinic(Tables S10-S13). Taken together, this analysis further corroborates the conclusion that most adverse effects, with  the  potential  exception  of  myalgia  in  the  week  following  second  vaccination,  are  not documented in the EHRs of vaccinated individuals at unexpectedly high rates.   .

10DiscussionThis  study  demonstrates  that  the  two  currently  FDA-authorized  COVID-19  vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, are safe and tolerated beyond the confines of a clinical trial setting. This conclusion is consistent with the extensive safety and tolerability assessments conducted in Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 trials over the past nine months and in the post-marketing surveillance efforts which are currently under way4,5,18,33,34. Here we assessed real world safety and tolerability by  longitudinally  curating  the  EHR  documentation  of  adverse  effects  in  31,029  individuals receiving  at  least  one  dose  of  a  COVID-19  vaccine  compared  to  a  propensity  matched unvaccinated cohort of similar size. Compared to this control cohort, vaccinated individuals were not more likely to return to the clinic (including the emergency department) or to report any of the surveyed adverse effects within 7, 14, or 21 days after the firstor second vaccine dose. When considering only the subsets of matched pairs who each had at least one clinical note in these defined time intervals, myalgia was the only symptom with a modest increase in documentation frequency among vaccinated individuals, while all other potential side effects occurred at similar or lower rates in this cohort. The  purpose  of  using  propensity  matching  in  this  study  was  to  establish  an  expected frequency  for  each  potential  vaccine  associated  adverse  effect  in  a  group  of  individuals  with similar demographic and geographic characteristics, akin to a placebo group in a randomized clinical trial. Our finding that EHR notes from vaccinated and propensity matched unvaccinated individuals record similar rates of potential vaccineassociated adverse effects differs from the data  obtained  in  Phase  3  trials,  wherein  vaccinated  participants  experienced  higher  rates  of symptoms  than  those  receiving  placebo.  Further,  the  absolute  rates  of  adverse  effects documented in these EHR notes are well below the rates reported in clinical trials (see Table 5)and  in  the  active  post-marketing  surveillance  of  these  vaccines  (V-safe)  (Table S14).  These discrepancies  are  likely  attributable  to  differences  in  the  populations  analyzed  and  the methodology of reporting symptoms.Regarding  the  populations  analyzed,  it  is  important  to  realize  that  adverse  effects experienced  by  healthcare  workers,  who  comprise  a  significant  proportion  of  the  Phase  1a vaccinated population thus far, are generally less likely to be documented in EHR notes. At many institutions, healthcare workers experiencing potential vaccine side effects are directed to follow up  with  Occupational  Health  Services,  which  is  an  entity  of  the  employer  and  thus  does  not document  the  reported  symptoms  in  EHR  notes.  Several  institutions  have  also  established COVID-19 response lines, which will usually direct individuals experiencing nonspecific vaccine side effects toward self-care. Further, healthcare workers may be less likely to report adverse effects at baseline given their clinical expertise and ability to self-assess the severity of their illness.Regarding reporting methods, both trials included a 7-day post-vaccination period in which symptoms were actively solicited from some or all individuals as well as longer periods in which unsolicited adverse effects and serious adverse reactions were recorded from all individuals. V-safe similarly solicits adverse effect reports from its voluntary participants on a regular basis. In contrast, our methods rely exclusively on the recording of unsolicited symptoms or events in the EHR. Given that individuals are warned of the likely vaccine associated adverse effects at the  .

11time of vaccination in the real world setting, it is likely that most mild or moderate symptoms are never actually reported and thus are not documented in an EHR note. That said, serious safety concerns by definition require medical care and thus are likely to be  documented  in  the  EHR.  For  example,  should  an  individual  experience  anaphylaxis,  this individual will likely require emergent care, during which one or more clinical notes will be written and will mention this phenotype. Thus, our method should identify the symptoms and phenotypes that represent the most serious threats to vaccine safety and tolerability of practical significance. Indeed, this is the central reason why our analysis should be viewed as complementary to the data  which  has  been  obtained  in  the  more  controlled  setting  of  clinical  trials.  It  is  extremely important  to  know  and  understand  the  frequencies  of  side  effects  which  were  observed  via solicitation in the trial setting, and this study does not contradict or refute this data in any way. Rather,  our  assessment  specifically  aims  to  describe  the  frequencies  of  adverse  effects  that receive some form of clinical attention as evidenced by their documentation in the EHR. In light of this, it is worth noting that the rate of severe side effects was actually similar among participants receiving vaccine or placebo in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Phase 3 trials at 2% or less, with the exception of severe fatigue in 3.8% of participants after their second dose of BNT162b24,5. This is consistent with our observations that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals have similar EHR documentation rates for each surveyed potential vaccine associated symptom. And our finding that vaccinated individuals are not more likely to receive emergent care provides further orthogonal support for the safety of these vaccines.There are several limitations of this study. First, while the analysis was conducted on a population  derived  from  a  large  healthcare  system,  the  cohort  demographics  are  not representative of the American population. For example, both the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts were predominantly Caucasian (>90%) and female (>60%). These biases likely reflect both the populations who receive care at the various Mayo Clinic centers and the populations who have been prioritized in Phase 1a of the vaccine rollout. The enrichment of healthcare workers amongindividuals vaccinated in this phase likely leads to an underestimation of the rates of return to clinic, due to the factors previously discussed (i.e. access to an Occupational Health Services office and other institution-specific COVID-19 response centers). However, it is worth noting that even those individuals who utilize such services are likely to generate EHR notes if they are indeed determined to require clinical attention or intervention. Second, the BERT model used to curate EHR notes does not imply a direct link between COVID-19 vaccination and the experience of a phenotype. That is, we simply capture the occurrence of an adverse effect without ensuring that the clinical note indeed suggests or confirms that vaccination caused the symptom. This shortcoming is addressed by comparing vaccinated individuals to the unvaccinated control cohort, which establishes a baseline expected frequency for each symptom in the absence of vaccination. Finally, while sentences suggesting the occurrence of anaphylaxis were manually reviewed to confirm both the positive sentiment and the tense (see Methods), sentences for the other curated phenotypes were not reviewed. In the future, we will train natural language processing models to discriminate past from present tense, thereby circumventing the need for this manual review.   As the remainder of the US population undergoes COVID-19 vaccination, it will not be feasible to conduct solicited reporting of adverse effects in all vaccinated individuals. Augmented curation of EHR notes for real world safety monitoring presents a practical solution to this problem  .

12which can be deployed to complement other directed surveillance efforts like V-safe. The method demonstrated  here  represents  a  scalable  approach  to  continuously  monitor  serious  safety concerns associated with any authorized COVID-19 vaccines. Taken together with our recent study highlighting the real world efficacy of these vaccines24, this data reinforces that individuals, providers, and public health officials should proceed rapidly with vaccination efforts, with high confidence in their efficacy and safety","As the COVID-19 vaccination campaign unfolds as one of the most rapid and widespread in history, it is important to continuously assess the real-world safety of the FDA-authorized vaccines. Curation  from  large-scale  electronic  health  records  (EHRs)  allows  for  near  real-time  safety evaluations that were not previously possible. Here, we advance context-and sentiment-aware deep neural  networks  over  the  multi-state  Mayo  Clinic  enterprise  (Minnesota,  Arizona,  Florida, Wisconsin) for automatically curating the adverse effects mentioned by healthcare providers in over 108,000 EHR clinical notes between December 1st2020 and February 8th2021. We retrospectively compared  the  clinical  notes  of  31,029  individuals  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine to those of 30,933 unvaccinated individuals who were propensity matched by demographics, residential location, and history of prior SARS-CoV-2 testing. We find that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were seen in the clinic at similar rates within 21 days of the first or second actual or assigned vaccination date (first dose Odds Ratio = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.10-1.18; second dose Odds Ratio = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86-0.96). Further, the incidence rates of all surveyed adverse effects were similar or lower in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals after either vaccine dose, although myalgia was modestly increased within 7 days of the second dose when considering only pairs of matched individuals who each had at least one clinical note in this time window (Incidence Rate Ratio = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.1-6.7). Finally, the most frequently documented adverse effects within 7 days of eachvaccine dose were fatigue (Dose 1: 1.75%, Dose 2: 1.18%), nausea (Dose 1: 1.03%, Dose 2: 0.84%), myalgia (Dose 1: 0.41%; Dose 2: 0.43%), diarrhea (Dose 1: 0.65%; Dose 2: 0.45%), arthralgia (Dose 1: 0.64%; Dose 2: 0.57%), erythema (Dose 1: 0.56%; Dose 2: 0.44%), vomiting (Dose 1: 0.44%, Dose 2: 0.29%) and fever (Dose 1: 0.21%; Dose 2: 0.18%). These frequencies of adverse event documentation in EHR notes are 2.1 times (95% CI: [1.5, 3.0]) to 1500 times (95% CI: [670, 2800]) lower than the frequencies of adverse events recorded via active solicitation  during  clinical  trials  or  post-marketing  surveillance,  with  headache  after  second vaccination showing the highest ratio of trial reporting to EHR documentation. This rapid and timely analysis of EHR notes from 31,029 vaccinated individuals highlights the rarity of vaccine-associated adverse  effects  requiring  clinical  attention  and  reaffirms  the  tolerability  of  the  FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines in practice."
"Association of Intravenous Bamlanivimab Use with Reduced Hospitalization, Intensive Care Unit Admission, and Mortality in Patients with Mild to Moderate COVID-19","Background: Clinical data to support the use of bamlanivimab for the treatment of outpatients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is needed. Methods: 2,335 patients who received single-dose bamlanivimab infusion between November 12, 2020 to February 17, 2021 were compared with a propensity-matched control of 2,335 untreated patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 at Mayo Clinic facilities across 4 states.  The primary outcome was the rate of hospitalization at days 14, 21 and 28. Results: The median age of the population was 63; 47.3% of the bamlanivimab-treated cohort were ≥65 years; 49.3% were female. High-risk characteristics included hypertension (54.2%), body mass index ≥35 (32.4%), diabetes mellitus (26.5%), chronic lung disease (25.1%), malignancy (16.6%), and renal disease (14.5%). Patients who received bamlanivimab had lower all-cause hospitalization rates at days 14 (1.5% vs 3.5%; Odds Ratio [OR], 0.38), 21 (1.9% vs 3.9%; OR, 0.46), and 28 (2.5% vs 3.9%; OR, 0.61). Secondary exploratory outcomes included lower intensive care unit admission rates at days 14 (0.14% vs 1%; OR, 0.12), 21 (0.25% vs 1%; OR: 0.24) and 28 (0.56% vs 1.1%; OR: 0.52), and lower all-cause mortality at days 14 (0% vs 0.33%), 21 (0.05% vs 0.4%; OR,0.08) and 28 (0.11% vs 0.44%; OR, 0.01). Adverse events were uncommon with bamlanivimab, occurring in 19/2355, most commonly fever (n=6), nausea (n=5), and lightheadedness (n=3). Conclusions: Among high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, treatment with bamlanivimab was associated with a statistically significant lower rate of hospitalization compared with usual care.

Introduction Control of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic requires prevention, early diagnosis, and effective treatment. Enhanced testing has allowed for early identification of infected individuals who do not yet require hospitalization but are at high risk for complications. Most treatments authorized or approved in 2020 were targeted at late stage disease and critical illness, but new treatments are emerging to intervene earlier in the course of illness for high-risk individuals. One treatment option for these individuals is anti-spike neutralizing monoclonal antibody, which has been authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Bamlanivimab was authorized on November 9, 2020, the combination of casirivimab-imdevimab on November 21, 2020, and the combination of bamlanivimab-etesevimab on February 9, 2021.1-3 These monoclonal antibodies inhibit the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE-2 receptors, thereby preventing viral attachment and infectivity.4 On April 16, 2021, the FDA had revoked the EUA for bamlanivimab monotherapy due to concerns over emerging resistance patterns in SARS-CoV-2 variants.5A phase 2 placebo-controlled trial showed decreased Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations among patients administered bamlanivimab,6 leading to it being granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA.1,7 However, the utilization of bamlanivimab has been slow, owing partly to the complexities of implementing outpatient infusion centers for infectious patients.8 Further, some patients were wary of investigational treatment and clinicians were skeptical in recommending these therapies due to limited clinical evidence and initial lack of endorsement by national societies.9-11Mayo Clinic developed dedicated infusion facilities and assembled multidisciplinary teams to coordinate monoclonal antibody infusions to patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) who are eligible under the EUA.12,13 This study was conducted to analyze the association of bamlanivimab monotherapy with clinical outcomes  in high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.

Methods Monoclonal Antibody Treatment Program The Mayo Clinic Monoclonal Antibody Treatment (MATRx) program was established on November 7, 2020, and the first patients were infused with bamlanivimab on November 19, 2020. The details of this program have been reported.12 A multidisciplinary team reviewed all patients identified from an electronic registry of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests and self- and clinician-referred patients. Under the EUA, patients were eligible for bamlanivimab if they had mild to moderate COVID-19, were within 10 days of symptom onset, and had at least one of the following criteria: age ≥65 years, body mass index (BMI) ≥35, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppressive medication use, or an immunocompromising condition. Patients 55 years and older qualified if they had hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or chronic lung disease. All eligible patients were approached by MATRx team members for education and consenting.    Study Design and Participants This retrospective study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.  Informed consent was waived and patients without research authorization were excluded. The study enrolled adult (≥ 18 years old) patients identified from the Mayo Clinic electronic health record (EHR) database with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests between November 12, 2020 and February 17, 2021. The start date November 12, 2020 was selected as it was the earliest test date for a patient who was infused with bamlanivimab monotherapy.  The study end date was selected as the most recent date with data available. The participant selection algorithm (Figure 1) resulted into two cohorts balanced for relevant demographic and clinical covariates: (1) treated patients who received bamlanivimab infusion, and (2) control patients who did not receive bamlanivimab after COVID-19 diagnosis.

Participant Selection and Propensity Score Matching The study population was selected from the pool of adult patients with COVID-19 who met the following criteria: (1) had not received casirivimab and imdevimab at any time during the study period, (2) did not have a cancelled bamlanivimab order, (3) were not on hospice or comfort care, (4) did not have a do not intubate (DNI), do not resuscitate (DNR), or do not hospitalize (DNH) status, (5) had minimum SpO2 of ≥93%, and (6) not currently hospitalized at the time of positive PCR test or bamlanivimab infusion. For each patient in the treated cohort, the enrollment date was defined as the date of bamlanivimab infusion. A histogram of infusion dates relative to PCR diagnosis dates is provided in eFigure 1. Propensity score matching was performed to select matched controls balanced on covariates that may influence bamlanivimab administration (Table 1).15 Propensity scores were computed for each patient by fitting an L1-regularized logistic regression model to predict which of the two cohorts the patient was in, as a function of the covariates detailed in the next section.16 To identify a matched control for each treated patient,  a set of control patients with the same age (+/- 5 years) and PCR diagnosis date (+/- 7 days) was considered, and the  patient with the closest propensity score was selected, if the propensity score difference was less than the selected threshold.  If the control patient (1) had a minimum SpO2 < 93%, (2) was hospitalized, (3) had an active DNR, DNI or DNH status, (4) was receiving only palliative or comfort care, or (5) was deceased on or before the date of study enrollment, then a new control patient (the next nearest neighbor by propensity score) was selected. Controls could not have received bamlanivimab due to the time limits of the EUA. This process was repeated until an eligible match was found. If an eligible match was not found, the search was expanded to the set of control patients with age +/- 5 years and PCR diagnosis dates +/- 14 days relative to the bamlanivimab patient. If the expanded search did not find any control patients, the bamlanivimab-treated patient was dropped from the analysis. The caliper threshold was set to 0.1 * pooled standard deviation of the propensity scores in the logit space. For each control patient, the study enrollment date was defined based on the number of days between the positive PCR test and bamlanivimab infusion for the matched treated patient (eFigure 2).17,18All rights reserved.

Demographic and clinical covariates To perform propensity matching described above, demographic and clinical covariates which could influence the likelihood of bamlanivimab administration were considered (Table 1). Demographic covariates considered included age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Race and ethnicity were determined based on patient entered responses to multiple choice questions with fixed categories and were considered in this study in order to control for social determinants of health and other potential confounding factors. Clinical covariates were derived from the Charlson Comorbidity Index and were identified for each patient on the basis of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes recorded in the 5 years prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing date (eTable 1).  Other covariates considered during the propensity score matching included hypertension, BMI, immunosuppressive medication usage, and location of infusion.  Hypertension status was determined using ICD-10 codes recorded in the 5 years prior to the PCR testing date (eTable 1). BMI was calculated using most recently recorded weight (between one year before and one week after COVID-19 diagnosis) and height (between age 18 and one week after COVID-19 diagnosis). Immunosuppressive medication usage was determined using medication orders active or completed in the year prior to the PCR testing date up to the end of the study period (eTable 4). This study included participants from four major sites: Scottsdale, Arizona; Jacksonville, Florida; Rochester, Minnesota; and other Mayo Clinic Health Systems sites. Location of infusion was incorporated into the covariate balancing analysis post-hoc. Due to the small number of sites, this variable was modelled as a fixed effect.14Outcomes All rights reserved.

The clinical outcomes that were assessed between the bamlanivimab-treated and control cohorts at days 14, 21, and 28 after study enrollment were rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, and number of hospital- and ICU-free days. Hospitalization rate was the primary outcome of interest. To determine the outcome for each cohort, only patients with sufficient follow-up data relative to the end study date (February 17, 2021) were considered.  For example, to determine the 14-day outcomes for each cohort, only patients with enrollment dates on or prior to February 3, 2021 were included.   Statistical analyses Prior to the statistical analysis, missing values were imputed. Among all of the covariates, the only ones with missing data were race (0.8%), ethnicity (1.8%), and BMI (17.9%) (see Table 1).  For covariates with missing data, the missing values were categorized as “Unknown”.  The effectiveness of covariate balancing between bamlanivimab-treated and control cohort was assessed using the standardized difference.17,18 To compare the rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death at the defined time points after study enrollment, the percentage of patients positive for each outcome relative to the total number of patients with follow-up in each cohort was calculated. For each of these outcome variables, a logistic regression model was fit using the treatment variable, controlling for all of the covariates considered during the propensity-matching step as potential residual confounding factors.19For each outcome, the odds ratio (OR; bamlanivimab versus control) was computed along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values. In addition, for each outcome, the absolute difference in days was reported, along with the 95% CI for this difference.  The logistic regression models were implemented using the “statsmodels” package (v.0.10.0) in python.20 To test the robustness of study findings, post-hoc “negative outcome” and “intention-to-treat” sensitivity analyses were conducted, as described below.

To compare hospital-free and ICU-free days at the defined time points after study enrollment, the mean number of hospital-free and ICU-free days among patients with follow-up were calculated for each cohort, along with their 95% CI. The differences in means (95% CI) were calculated, and significance was assessed with a Mann-Whitney test.  Because of the potential for type 1 error due to multiple comparisons, analysis of the secondary outcomes should be interpreted as exploratory. For each of the statistical tests, a two-sided p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analysis was performed with the aid of the “scipy” package (v0.25.6) in Python.22Hospitalization-free survival was also assessed at daily intervals with a Kaplan-Meier analysis and a corresponding log-rank test. Specifically, the proportion of patients in each cohort (among those with follow-up) who were not hospitalized on each day after study enrollment was compared (eTable 3, Figure 2). Survival analysis was performed using the “lifelines” package (v0.25.6) in Python.23Post-hoc statistical tests were done to account the fact that the endpoints were measured at multiple timepoints. For each of the survival-type outcomes (hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality), the p-values from 28-day capped log-rank tests between the propensity matched cohorts were reported. These tests are used to assess whether or not the hospital admission rates, ICU admission rates, and mortality rates are significantly different between the matched cohorts within the 28 day follow-up period. Log-rank tests were performed using the “lifelines” (v0.25.6) package in Python. For each of the numeric outcomes (number of hospital-free days and number of ICU-free days), we report p-values from two-way mixed ANOVA tests, using treatment (bamlanivimab or control) as the between-subjects factor and time point (14, 21, or 28 days) as the within-subjects factor.24 Mixed ANOVA tests were performed using the “pingouin” (v0.3.11) package in Python, with the Greenhouse-Geisser correction applied afterwards to adjust for violations of the sphericity assumption.

Two post-hoc sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the findings. First, in order to test the sensitivity of the study findings to potential unobserved confounding variables, the statistical analysis was repeated on a “negative outcome” suspected to be unrelated to COVID-19 disease or treatment. For this post-hoc sensitivity analysis, cancer screening was considered as the negative outcome. In particular, the negative outcome was defined as +1 for patients with an ICD-10 diagnostic code for cancer screening (Z12.*) 15 to 42 days following their PCR diagnosis date, and 0 otherwise.  Patients with PCR diagnosis dates after February 8, 2021 were excluded from this sensitivity analysis due to lack of 42-day follow-up data.   Second, an “intention-to-treat"" sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare the outcomes between all patients who received an order for bamlanivimab versus the control group. In this analysis, all patients with cancelled orders for bamlanivimab was considered in addition to the bamlanivimab-treated patients, subjected to the same inclusion criteria. For each of the patients with cancelled bamlanivimab orders, the relative infusion dates were randomly sampled from the distribution of relative infusion dates for the actual bamlanivimab-treated cohort, ensuring that the infusion dates were within the study period. A 1:1 propensity matching was performed between the bamlanivimab intended-to-treat cohort and the control cohort, following the same procedure as in the primary analysis. The rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality for the matched cohorts were compared for the 14, 21, and 28-day time horizons.  Results Patient population Of the 33,446 adult patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, the participant selection algorithm (Figure 1) resulted into two cohorts that were balanced for relevant demographic and clinical covariates: (1) bamlanivimab-treated patients (n = 2,335), and (2) control patients (n = 2,335) who did not receive All rights reserved.

monoclonal antibody (Table 1). Appropriate matches could not be found for 101 bamlanivimab-treated patients which led to a decrease in size of our bamlanivimab cohort from 2,436 to 2,335. Unmatched data is shown in eTable 2 and the effect of propensity score matching on these variables is shown in eTable 3. All covariates showed standardized differences < 0.1 confirming that the cohorts were reasonably balanced for reliable downstream comparisons (Table 1). The success of balancing was also confirmed by comparing the age distribution (eFigure 3) and the prevalence of each categorical covariate (eFigure 4) in the two cohorts before and after propensity matching. Distribution of test results across the two cohorts is shown in eFigure 5.  The mean time from PCR date to bamlanivimab infusion was 2.79 days (median, 2 days) (eFigure 4).The most common comorbidities were hypertension (54.2%), diabetes mellitus (26.5%), chronic lung disease (25.1%), renal disease (14.5%), malignancy (16.6%), peripheral vascular disease (14.6%), liver disease (9.6%), congestive heart failure (9.0%), and immunosuppressive drug use (6.1%). Primary Outcome All-cause hospitalization All-cause hospitalization rates were significantly lower in the bamlanivimab group than the propensity-matched cohort at days 14 (1.5% vs 3.5% (difference, 2.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2%-3.0%);Odds Ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI: 0.25-0.59), 21 (1.9% vs 3.9%(difference, 2.0%; 95% CI: 0.91%-3.0%); OR, 0.46; 95% CI: 0.30-0.70), and 28 (2.5% vs 3.9%  (difference 1.5%; 95% CI: 0.33%-2.6%); OR, 0.61; 95% CI: 0.41-0.91) (Table 2). Bamlanivimab-treated patients had significantly more hospitalization-free days at all time points, compared to the propensity-matched cohort (Table 3). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significant separation in rate of hospitalization-free survival between the bamlanivimab-treated and propensity-matched control (log-rank test p-value 0.01; Figure 2).

","This retrospective study shows that bamlanivimab monotherapy was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the rate of all-cause hospitalization at 28 days after infusion, with greater effects demonstrated at 14 and 21 days.25Among high-risk patients 65 years and older and those with BMI >35 who participated in the phase 2 randomized clinical  trial, the rate of hospitalization and medically-attended visit was 4% among bamlanivimab-treated patients compared to 15% among those who received placebo.6 Our reported rates in this study are numerically lower, especially among the untreated propensity-matched control group.6This difference could have been due to the different time point of enrollment, as the current cohort represents a contemporary population when the care of COVID-19 patients has improved. The lower rate of hospitalization in the untreated cohort lessened the anticipated magnitude of impact of bamlanivimab therapy. Nonetheless, this study observed that bamlanivimab was significantly associated with reduction in all-cause hospitalizations, by 57% at day 14 and 31% by day 28.  This study suggests that bamlanivimab-treated patients were less likely to progress to critical illness, supported by the lower rates of intensive care unit admission and mortality, notable in a cohort that included only the high-risk population. 26,27  By virtue of the strict FDA EUA criteria, 100% of the bamlanivimab-treated population had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19.6 As prior studies have All rights reserved.

suggested that patients with medical comorbidities are at higher risk of severe and critical illness, early treatment with bamlanivimab may have mitigated this progression.28,29Due to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, bamlanivimab is no longer authorized for use as monotherapy . Despite this, the results of this study which showed the real-world efficacy of bamlanivimab monotherapy in the prevention of hospital admission and other serious clinical outcomes, provides proof that treatment with neutralizing antibodies is an effective strategy to mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic. The observations in this study could serve as a model that may be translatable to the use of other monoclonal antibody combination therapies which are still available. Limitations This study has several limitations. First, this was an observational cohort study, and precludes the causal inference that can result from a randomized clinical trial. However, performing a randomized trial was not feasible due to the ethical implications of withholding a drug authorized for emergency use in the treatment of high-risk patients. Propensity score matching was performed in an attempt to reduce confounding bias. Furthermore, two sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the matching procedure was effective in controlling for potential confounding variables. Second, this study had a retrospective design, and may not have captured all the clinical outcomes of patients who may have received subsequent care in other institutions. This limitation is mitigated by the extensive outpatient remote monitoring and follow up program.30  Also, only patients with documented follow up were included in the analysis of outcomes at days 14, 21 and 28. Third, this study focused on bamlanivimab monotherapy and did not include patients who received casirivimab and imdevimab or bamlanivimab and etesevimab combination therapy. The clinical outcomes reported here therefore only apply to one specific monoclonal antibody, for which the EUA has been revoked secondary to resistance patterns of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in the community.5 Fourth, the study population was predominantly White, and further studies will need to be All rights reserved.

performed to validate the findings in other populations. Fifth, the outcomes data was derived from a single multi-site healthcare system which proactively screened and consented all eligible patients leading to rapid infusion of monoclonal antibody, and thus, the results may not be generalizable to other systems with different practices. Sixth, despite the large patient population and the statistical significance, the magnitude of some findings is small. In particular, the difference in ICU-free and hospitalization-free days are small when considered at the patient level. However, this small difference can be magnified when considered at the larger population level.","Background: Clinical data to support the use of bamlanivimab for the treatment of outpatients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is needed. Methods: 2,335 patients who received single-dose bamlanivimab infusion between November 12, 2020 to February 17, 2021 were compared with a propensity-matched control of 2,335 untreated patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 at Mayo Clinic facilities across 4 states.  The primary outcome was the rate of hospitalization at days 14, 21 and 28. Results: The median age of the population was 63; 47.3% of the bamlanivimab-treated cohort were ≥65 years; 49.3% were female. High-risk characteristics included hypertension (54.2%), body mass index ≥35 (32.4%), diabetes mellitus (26.5%), chronic lung disease (25.1%), malignancy (16.6%), and renal disease (14.5%). Patients who received bamlanivimab had lower all-cause hospitalization rates at days 14 (1.5% vs 3.5%; Odds Ratio [OR], 0.38), 21 (1.9% vs 3.9%; OR, 0.46), and 28 (2.5% vs 3.9%; OR, 0.61). Secondary exploratory outcomes included lower intensive care unit admission rates at days 14 (0.14% vs 1%; OR, 0.12), 21 (0.25% vs 1%; OR: 0.24) and 28 (0.56% vs 1.1%; OR: 0.52), and lower all-cause mortality at days 14 (0% vs 0.33%), 21 (0.05% vs 0.4%; OR,0.08) and 28 (0.11% vs 0.44%; OR, 0.01). Adverse events were uncommon with bamlanivimab, occurring in 19/2355, most commonly fever (n=6), nausea (n=5), and lightheadedness (n=3). Conclusions: Among high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, treatment with bamlanivimab was associated with a statistically significant lower rate of hospitalization compared with usual care."
Augmented Curation of Clinical Notes from a Massive EHR System Reveals Symptoms of Impending COVID-19 Diagnosis,"Understanding  temporal  dynamics  of  COVID-19  patient  symptoms  could  provide  fine-grained resolution to guide clinical decision-making. Here,we use deep neural networksover an institution-wide platform for the augmented curation of clinical notes from 77,167 patients subjected to COVID-19 PCR testing. By contrasting Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived symptoms  of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos;n=2,317) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg;n=74,850) patients forthe week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (27.1-fold), fever/chills (2.6-fold), respiratory difficulty (2.2-fold), cough (2.2-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2-fold), and diarrhea (1.4-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDposover COVIDnegpatients. The combination of cough and fever/chills has 4.2-fold amplification in COVIDpospatients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19. This study introduces an Augmented Intelligenceplatform for the real-time synthesis of institutional biomedical knowledge.  The  platform  holds  tremendous  potential  for  scaling  up  curation throughput,thus enablingEHR-powered early disease diagnosis.IntroductionCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of June 3, 2020, according to WHO there have been  more  than  6.3  million  confirmed  cases  worldwide  and  more  than  379,941  deaths  attributable  to COVID-19 (https://covid19.who.int/). The clinical course and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 varies substantially,  even  among  patients  with  similar  age  and  comorbidities.  Following  exposure  and  initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, likely through the upper respiratory tract, patients can remain asymptomatic with active viral replication for days before symptoms manifest1–3. The asymptomatic nature of initial SARS-CoV-2 infection patients may be exacerbating the rampant community transmission observed4. It remains unknown why certain patients become symptomatic, and in those that do, the timeline of symptoms remains poorly  characterized  and  non-specific.  Symptoms  may  include  fever,  fatigue,  myalgias,  loss  of  appetite, loss of smell (anosmia), and altered sense of taste, in addition to the respiratory symptoms of dry cough, dyspnea,  sore  throat,  and  rhinorrhea,  as  well  as  gastrointestinal  symptoms  of  diarrhea,  nausea,  and abdominal  discomfort5.  A  small  proportion  of  COVID-19  patients progress  to  severe  illness,  requiring hospitalization or intensive care management; among these individuals, mortality due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is higher6. The estimated average time from symptom onset to resolution can range from three days to more than three weeks, with a high degree of variability7. The COVID-19 public  .

2health  crisis  demands  a  data  science-driven  approach  to  quantify  the  temporal  dynamics  of  COVID-19 pathophysiology and promote more effective clinical management.Here we introduce a platform for the augmented curation of the full-spectrum of patient symptoms from the Mayo Clinic EHRs for 77,167 patients with positive/negative COVID-19 diagnosis by PCR testing (see Methods).  The  platform  utilizes  state-of-the-art  transformer  neural  networks  on  the  unstructured clinical  notes  to  automate  entity  recognition  (e.g.  diseases,  drugs,  symptoms),  quantify  the  strength  of contextual  associations  between  entities,  and  characterize  the  nature  of  association  into  “positive”, “negative”,  “suspected”,  or  “other”  sentiments.  We  identify  specific  sensory,  respiratory,  and  gastro-intestinal  symptoms,  as  well  as  some  specificcombinations,  that  appear  to  be  indicative  of  impending COVIDposdiagnosis by PCR testing. This highlights the potential for neural network-powered EHR curation to facilitate a significantly earlier diagnosis of COVID-19 than currently feasible. ResultsThe clinical determination of the COVID-19 status for each patient was conducted using the SARS-CoV-2 PCR (RNA) test approved for human nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens under the  U.S.  FDA  emergency  use  authorization  (EUA)8.  This  PCR  test  resulted  in  74,850  COVIDnegpatient diagnoses  and  2,317  COVIDpospatient  diagnoses.  The  COVIDposcohort  had  a  mean  age  of  41.9  years (standard deviation = 19.1 years) and was 51% male and 49% female while the COVIDnegcohort had a mean age of 50.7 years (standard deviation = 21.4 years) and was 43% male and 57% female. Only 11 (0.5%) of COVIDposand 196 (0.3%) of COVIDnegpatients were hospitalized 7 days or more prior to PCR testing, indicating that the vast majority of patients were not experiencing serious illness prior to this time window.  During  the  week  prior  to  PCR  testing,  135  (5.8%)  of  the  COVIDposand  5,981  (8.0%)  of  the COVIDnegpatients  were  hospitalized.  Additionally,  the  frequencies  of  ICD10  diagnosis  codes  for  these cohorts were found for the week prior to PCR testing, with unspecified acute upper respiratory infection appearing in over 20% of both cohorts (Supplementary file S1a-b). In order to investigate the time course of COVID-19progression in patients and better define the presence or absence of symptoms, we used BERT-based deep neural networks to extract symptoms and their putative synonyms from the clinical notes for the week prior to the date when the COVID-19 diagnosis test was taken (see Methods; Table 1). For the purpose of this analysis, all patients were temporally aligned, by setting the date of COVID-19 PCR testing to ‘day 0’, and the proportion of patients demonstrating each symptom derived from the EHR over each day of the week preceding and post PCR testing was tabulated (Table 2). As a negative control, we included a non-COVID-19 symptom ‘dysuria’.Altered  or  diminished  sense  of  taste  or  smell  (dysgeusia  or  anosmia)  is  the  most  significantly amplified signal in COVIDposover COVIDnegpatients in the week preceding PCR testing (Table 1; 27.1-fold amplification;  p-value  <<  1E-100).  This  result  suggests  that  anosmia  and  dysgeusia  are  likely  the  most salient early indicators of COVID-19 infection, including in otherwise asymptomatic patients.However, it must be noted that the prevalence of a symptom in the population must be taken into consideration. Thus, while anosmia and dysgeusia see the most dramatic difference in prevalence between the COVIDposand COVIDnegcohorts,the overall prevalence of 318 out of 77,167 patients, or 0.4%, precludes it from being a standalone predictor of infection. Alternatively, fever/chills also have an increased signal in the COVIDposcompared to the COVIDnegcohort (2.6-fold amplification; p-value = 3.6E-169) while appearing in 10,171 out of 77,167 patients (13.2%). Diarrhea is also significantly amplifiedin the COVIDpospatients forthe week preceding PCR testing (Table 1; 1.4-fold; p-value = 3.5E-06). Some of these not yet diagnosed COVID-19 patients that experience diarrhea  prior  to  PCR  testing  may  be  unintentionally  shedding  SARS-CoV-2  fecally9,10.

3observed copious SARS-CoV-2 RNA9,10. The amplification of diarrhea in COVIDposover COVIDnegpatients for the week preceding PCR testing raises concern for other modes of viral transmission and highlights the importance of washing hands frequently in addition to wearing respiratory protection.As may be expected, respiratory difficulty is enriched in the week prior to PCR testing in COVIDposover  COVIDnegpatients  (1.9-fold  amplification;  p-value  =  1.1E-22; Table  1).  Among  other  common phenotypes  with  significant  enrichments  in  COVIDposover  COVIDnegpatients,  cough  has  a  2.2-fold amplification (p-value = 4.6E-129) andmyalgia/arthralgia has a 2.0-fold amplification (p-value = 5.3E-34). Rhinitis  is  also  a  potential  early  signal  of  COVIDpospatients  that  requires  some  consideration  (2.2-fold amplification, p-value = 2.25E-29). Finally, dysuria was included as a negative control for COVID-19,and consistent with this assumption, 0.69% of COVIDpospatients and 0.97% of COVIDnegpatients had dysuria during the week preceding PCR testing.Next, we considered the 351 possible pairwise combinations of 27 symptoms (Supplementary file S1c) for COVIDposversus COVIDnegpatients in the week prior to the PCR testing date (Supplementary file S1d). As expected from the previous results, altered sense of smell or taste (anosmia/dysgeusia) dominates in combination with many of the aforementioned symptoms as the most significant combinatorial signature of  impending  COVIDposdiagnosis  (particularly  along  with  cough,  respiratory  difficulty,  and  fever/chills). Examining the other 325 possible pairwise symptom combinations, excluding the altered sense of smell of taste, reveals other interesting combinatorial signals. The combination of cough and diarrhea is noted to be significant  in  COVIDposover  COVIDnegpatients  during  the  week  preceding  PCR  testing;  i.e.  cough  and diarrhea co-occur in 8.0% of COVIDpospatientsand only 2.8% of COVIDnegpatients, indicating a 2.8-fold amplification of this specific symptom combination (BH corrected p-value = 5.6E-32,Supplementary file S1d).We further investigated the temporal evolution of the proportion of patients with each symptom for the week prior to PCR testing (Table 2). Altered sense of taste or smell, cough, diarrhea, fever/chills, and respiratory  difficulty  were  found  to  be  significant  discriminators  of  COVIDposfrom  COVIDnegpatients between 4 to 7 days prior to PCR testing. During that time period, cough is significantly amplified (> 3-fold, p-value < 0.05) in the COVIDpospatient cohort over the COVIDnegpatient cohort by 5.2-fold on day -7 (p-value = 8.4E-40), 4.31-fold on day -6(p-value = 7.44E-28), 3.6-fold on day -5 (p-value = 2.4E-18), and 3.1-fold on day -4 (p-value = 2.7E-12). The diminishing odds of cough as a symptom from 7 to 4 days preceding the  PCR  testing  date  is  notable  and  this  temporal  pattern  could  potentially  suggest  that  the  duration  of cough  and  other  symptoms,  in  addition  to  their  presence  or  absence,  is  a  useful  indicator  of  infection. Similarly, diarrhea is amplified in the COVIDpospatient cohort over the COVIDnegpatient cohort for days furthest preceding from the PCR testing date, with an amplification of 2.2-fold on day -7 (p-value = 5.6E-04) and 1.8-fold on day -6 (p-value = 1.2E-02). Likewise, fever/chills and respiratory difficulty both show matching trends, with significant amplification in the COVIDposcohort on days -7 to -4 and days -7 to -5, respectively.  However, unlike diarrhea, cough, fever/chills, and respiratory difficulty, we find that change in appetite  may  be  considered  a  subsequent  symptom  of  impending  COVID-19  diagnosis,  with  significant amplification in the COVIDposcohort over the COVIDnegcohort on day -4 (3.7-fold, p-value = 3.53E-06), day -3 (3.1-fold, p-value = 3.4E-04), and day -2 (2.9-fold, p-value = 9.4E-05). The delay in the onset of change in appetite/intake compared to the other aforementioned symptoms indicates that this change only appears after other symptoms have already manifested and thus could be secondary to these symptoms rather than directly caused by infection.This high-resolution temporal overview of the EHR-derived clinical symptoms as they manifest prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic testing date for 77,167 patients has revealed specific enriched signals of impending COVID-19 onset. These clinical insights can help modulate social distancing measures and appropriate  clinical  care  for  individuals  exhibiting  the  specific  sensory  (anosmia,  dysgeusia),  respiratory (cough, difficulty breathing), gastro-intestinal (diarrhea, change in appetite/intake), and other (fever/chills,  .

4arthralgia/myalgia)  symptoms  identified  herein,  including  for  patients  awaiting  conclusive  COVID-19 diagnostic testing results (e.g. by SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR).DiscussionWhile  PCR  testing  is  the  current  diagnostic  standard  of  COVID-19,  identifying  risk  of  a  positive diagnosis earlier is essential to mitigate the spread of the virus. Patients with these symptom risk factors could be tested earlier, undergo closer monitoring, and be adequately quarantined to not only ensure better treatment for the patient, but to prevent the infection of others. Additionally, as businesses begin to reopen, understanding these risk factors will be critical in areas where comprehensive PCR testing is not possible. This  study  demonstrates  how  such  symptoms  can  be  extracted  from  highly  unstructured  institutional knowledge  and  synthesized  using  deep  learning  and  neural  networks11.Such  augmented  curation, providing  fine-grained,  temporal  resolution  of  symptoms,  can  be  applied  toward  supporting  differential diagnosis of patients in a clinical setting.Expanding beyond one institution’s COVID-19 diagnostic testing and clinical care to the EHR databases of other academic medical centers and health systems will provide a  more  holistic  view  of  clinical  symptoms  enriched  in  COVIDposover  COVIDnegpatients  in  the  days preceding confirmed diagnostic testing. This requires leveraging a privacy-preserving, federated software architecture  that  enables each  medical  center  to  retain  the  span  of  control  of  their  de-identified  EHR databases, while enabling the machine learning models from partners to be deployed in their secure cloud infrastructure. To this end, seamless multi-institute collaborations over an Augmented Intelligence platform, which puts patient privacy and HIPAA-compliance first, are being advanced actively over the Mayo Clinic’s Clinical Data Analytics Platform Initiative (CDAP). The capabilities demonstrated in this study for rapidly synthesizing unstructured clinical notes to develop an EHR-powered clinical diagnosis framework will be further strengthened through such a universal biomedical research platform. There are a few caveats that must be considered when relying solely on EHR inference to track symptoms preceding the PCR testing date. In addition to concerns regarding testing accuracy, there is an inherent  delay  in  PCR  testing,  which  arises  because both  the  patient  and  physician  must  decide  thesymptomswarrant PCR testing. More specifically, to be tested, the patient must first consider the symptoms serious enough to visit the clinic and then the physician must determine the symptoms present a possibility of COVID infection. The length of this delay could also be influenced by how well-informed the public is of COVID-19 signs and symptoms, the availability of PCR testing, and the hospital protocols used to determine which patients get tested. Each of these factors would be absent or limited at the beginning of a pandemic but  would  increase  or  improve  over  time.  However,  this  makes  synchronization  across  patients  difficult because  the  delay  between  symptom  onset  and  PCR  testing  changes  over  time.  For  example,  patients infected early in the pandemic would be less inclined to visit the clinic with mild symptoms, while those infected later have more information and more cause to get tested earlier. Similarly, in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when PCR testing was limited, physicians were forced to reserve tests for more severe cases or for those who were in direct contact with a COVIDposindividual, whereas now PCR testing is more widespread. In each case, the delay between symptom onset and PCR testing would be expected to change over time fora given patient population. Additionally,  there  are  caveats  surrounding  data  availability  when  working  with  such  real-world datasets, including data sparsity and reporting. For example, while each patient had at least one clinic visit, accompanied by physician notes, between days -7 and 0, only 6 (0.3%) of the COVIDposand 372 (0.5%) of the COVIDnegpatients had notes from all 7 days prior to PCR testing. Moreover, the number of patients with notes  prior  to  PCR  testing  tends  to  decrease  each  day  prior  to  the  PCR  testing  date  for  both  cohorts(Supplementary file S1e). With regard to reporting, mild symptoms, particularly those seemingly unrelated to presentation for clinical care, such as anosmia, may go unreported.Finally, it should also be noted that  .

5COVIDnegpatients may not necessarily be representative of a “healthy” cohort comparable to a randomly selected group from the general population, as these patients each had a reason for seeking out COVID-19  PCR  testing.With  all  of  these  caveats  in  mind,  the  factthat  the  temporal  distribution  of  symptoms significantly  differs  between  the COVIDposand COVIDnegpatients  remains  and  demonstrates  that synchronization using the PCR testing date is apt for the real-world data analysis described herein. Thus, by understanding the temporal progression of symptoms prior to PCR testing, we aim to reduce the delay between infection and testing in the future.As we continue to understand the diversity of COVID-19 patient outcomes through holistic inference of  EHR  systems,  it is  equally  important  to  invest  in  uncovering  the  molecular  mechanisms12and  gain cellular/tissue-scale  pathology  insights  through  large-scale  patient-derived  biobanking  and  multi-omics sequencing13. To correlate patterns of molecular expression from scRNA-seq with EHR-derived symptom signals  of  COVID-19  disease  progression,  a  large-scale  bio-banking  system  has  to  be  created.  Such  a system will enable deep molecular insights into COVID-19 to be gleaned and triangulated with SARS-CoV-2 tropism and patient outcomes, allowing researchers to better evaluate disease staging and synchronize patients for analyses similar to those presented here. Ultimately, connecting the dots between the temporal dynamics  of  COVIDposand  COVIDnegclinical  symptoms  across  diverse  patient  populations  to  the  multi-omics signals from patient-derived bio-specimen will help advance a more holistic understanding of COVID-19  pathophysiology.  This  will  set  the  stage  for  a  precision  medicine  approach  to  the  diagnostic  and therapeutic management of COVID-19 patients.MethodsAugmented curation of EHR patient chartsThe nferX Augmented Curation technology was leveraged to rapidly curatethe charts of SARS-CoV-2-positive  (COVIDpos)  patients.  First,  we  read  through  the  charts  of  100  COVIDpos patients  and identified  symptoms,  grouping  them  into  sets  of  synonymous  words  and  phrases.  For  example,  “SOB”, “shortness  of  breath”,  and  “dyspnea”,  among  others,  were  grouped  into  “shortness  of  breath”.  For  the SARS-CoV2-positive patients, we identified a total of 26 symptom categories (Supplementary file S1c) with 145 synonyms or synonymous phrases. Together, these synonyms and synonymous phrases capture how  symptoms  related  to  COVID-19  are  described  in  the  Mayo  Clinic  Electronic  Health  Record  (EHR) databases. Next,  for  charts  that  had  not  yet  been  manually  curated,  we  used  state-of-the-art  BERT-based neural  networks11to  classify  symptoms  as  being  present  or  not  present  in  each  patient  based  on  the surrounding phraseology. More specifically, SciBERT14, a BERT model pre-trained on 3.17B tokens from the biomedical and computer science domains, was compared to both domain-adapted BERT architectures (e.g. BioBERT15, ClinicalBioBERT16) and different transformer architectures (e.g. XLNet17, RoBERTa18, MT-DNN19). We found that SciBERT performed equally or better than these models (Supplementary file 1fand data not shown). SciBERT differs from other domain-adapted BERT architectures as it is trained de novo  on  a  biomedical  corpus,  whereas  BioBERT  is  initialized  with  the  BERT  base  vocabulary  and  fine-tuned with PubMed abstracts and PMC articles. Similarly, Clinical BioBERT is initialized with BioBERT and fine-tuned on MIMIC-III data. When comparing different transformer architectures, SciBERTand RoBERTa had equivalent performance, slightly better than the other models tested, including XLNet and MT-DNN (data  not  shown).  Thus,  SciBERT  was  chosen  for  the  analyses  performed,  using  the  architecture  and training configuration shown in Figure 1 andFigure 1-figure supplement 1.The neural network used to perform this classification was initially trained using 18,490 sentences containing nearly 250 different cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic diseases and phenotypes.

6sentence was manually classified into one of four categories: Yes (confirmed phenotype), No (ruled out phenotype), Maybe (suspected phenotype), and Other (alternate context, e.g. family history of a phenotype, risk of adverse event from medication, etc.), with examples of each classification shown in Supplementary Figure  1-figure  supplement  2.  Using  a  90%:10%  train:test  split,  the  model  achieved  93.6%  overall accuracy and a precision and recall of 95% or better for both positive and negative sentiment classification (Supplementary  file  S1g).  To  augment  this  model  with  COVID-related  symptoms,  3,188  sentences containing  26  different  symptoms  were  added  to  the  18,490  previously  tagged  sentences  for  a  total  of 21,678. Classification was performed using that same labels and model performance was equivalent to the previous  model,  with  an  overall  accuracy  of  94.0%  and  a  precision  and  recall  of  96%  or  better  for  both positive and negative sentiment classification (Supplementary file S1h).This  model  was  applied  to  35,790,640  clinical  notes  across  the  entire  medical  history  of  2,317 COVIDpospatients  and  74,850  COVIDnegpatients.  For  each  patient,  the  difference  between  the  date  on which a particular note was written and the PCR testing date were used to compute the relative date for that note. The PCR testing date was treated as ‘day 0’ with notes preceding it assigned ‘day -1’, ‘day -2’, and so on. BERT-based neural networks were applied on each note to identify the set of symptoms that were present at that time for each patient. This patient-to-symptom mapping over time was then inverted to determine the set of unique patients experiencing each symptom at any given time. Here, the presence of  a  symptom  was  defined  as  either  a  “Yes”  or  “Maybe”  classification  by  the  model. The  “Maybe” classification  was  included  because  of  differences  in  how  phenotypes/diseases  and  symptoms  are described   in   the   clinical   notes.   For   example,   when   physicians   describe   “evaluation   for”   a phenotype/disease, e.g. “the patient underwent evaluation for COVID-19”, it does not imply a diagnosis for the disease, rather the possibility of a diagnosis. On the other hand, when a patient is seen “for evaluation of cough, fever, and chills”, this statement suggests that these symptoms are present. Thus, we included both classifications for the definition of a symptom being present.To validate the accuracy of the BERT-based model for COVID-related symptoms, a validation step in which the classifications of 4001 such sentences from the timeframe of highest interest (day 0 to day-7) were  manually  verified.  Sentences  arising  from  templates,  such  as  patient  education  documentation, accounted for 10.2% of sentences identified. These template sentences were excluded from the analysis. The true positive rate, defined as the total number of correct classifications by the model divided by the number  of  total  classifications,  achieved  by  the  model  for  classifying  all  symptoms  was  96.7%;  the corresponding false positive rate was 6.1%. The model achieved true positive rates ranging from 93%to 100% for the major symptom categories of Fever/Chills, Cough, Respiratory Difficulty, Headache, Fatigue, Myalgia/Arthralgia, Dysuria, Change in appetite/intake, and Diaphoresis. Classification performance was slightly lower for Altered or diminished sense of taste and smell; here, the true positive rate was 82.2%. Detailed statistics are displayed in Supplementary file S1i. For each synonymous group of symptoms, we computed the count and proportion of COVIDposand COVIDnegpatients that had positive sentiment for that symptom in at least one note between 1 and 7 days prior to their PCR test. We additionally computed the ratio of those proportions to determine the prevalence of  the  symptom  in  the  COVIDposcohort  as  compared  to  the  COVIDnegcohort;  we  then  computed  95% confidence intervals around these ratios. A standard 2-proportion z hypothesis test was performed, and a p-value was reported for each symptom. A Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment was then applied on these 27-symptom p-values to account for multiple hypotheses. To capture the temporal evolution of symptoms in the COVIDposand COVIDneg cohorts, the process was repeated considering counts and proportions for each day independently. (note we report un-adjusted p-values only in the temporal analysis). Pairwise analysis of  phenotypes  was  performed  by  considering  351  symptom  pairs  from  the  original  set  of  27  individual symptoms.  For  each  pair,  we  calculated  the  number  of  patients  in  the  COVIDposand  COVIDnegcohorts wherein  both  symptoms  occurred  at  least  once  in  the  week  preceding  PCR  testing.

By contrasting Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived symptoms  of COVID-19-positive (COVIDpos;n=2,317) versus COVID-19-negative (COVIDneg;n=74,850) patients forthe week preceding the PCR testing date, we identify anosmia/dysgeusia (27.1-fold), fever/chills (2.6-fold), respiratory difficulty (2.2-fold), cough (2.2-fold), myalgia/arthralgia (2-fold), and diarrhea (1.4-fold) as significantly amplified in COVIDposover COVIDnegpatients. The combination of cough and fever/chills has 4.2-fold amplification in COVIDpospatients during the week prior to PCR testing, and along with anosmia/dysgeusia, constitutes the earliest EHR-derived signature of COVID-19.

Plasma IL-6 Levels following Corticosteroid Therapy as an Indicator of ICU Length of Stay in Critically ill COVID-19 Patients,"Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality in severe COVID-19 patients are driven  by  “cytokine  storms”  and  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS).  Interim clinical trial results suggest that the corticosteroid dexamethasone displays superior 28-day survival in severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation or oxygen. Among 16 patients with plasma IL-6 measurement post-corticosteroid administration, a higher proportion of patients with an IL-6 value over 10 pg/mL have worse outcomes (i.e. ICU Length of Stay > 15  days  or  death)  when  compared  to  41  patients  treated  with  non-corticosteroid  drugs including antivirals, tocilizumab, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine (p-value = 0.0024). Given  this  unexpected  clinical  association  between  post-corticosteroid  IL-6  levels  and COVID-19 severity, we hypothesized that the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR or NR3C1) may be coupled to IL-6 expression in specific cell types that govern cytokine release syndrome (CRS).  Examining  single  cell  RNA-seq  data  from  bronchoalveolar  lavage  fluid  of  severe COVID-19 patients and nearly 2 million human cells from a pan-tissue scan shows that alveolar macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells co-express both NR3C1 and IL-6. The mechanism of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) agonists mitigating pulmonary and multi-organ inflammation in some COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, may be in part due to their successful antagonism of IL-6 production within lung macrophages and vasculature.  IntroductionInfection with SARS-CoV-2 is largely asymptomatic or presents with mild-to-moderate symptoms in a majority of patients1, but can result in progressive respiratory illness leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a subset of severely ill COVID-19 patients2,3. Multiple  clinical  trials  are  underway  to  investigate  therapies  ranging  from  antivirals  (e.g. Lopinavir-Remdesivir) to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents (e.g. Dexamethasone, Tocilizumab)4.

2examining small patient cohorts have suggested treatment with tocilizumab (anti-IL6 receptor) may improve outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients6,7. Consequently, the use of plasma IL-6 testing  has  gained  traction  during  the  ongoing  COVID-19 pandemic  andsuggests  IL-6  as  a promising biomarker to study in the context of COVID-19. We were motivated by the observation that high sensitivity plasma IL-6 tests conducted at the Mayo Clinic between 2010 and 2019 show only 274 out of 1463 tests (18%) above 10 pg/mL (normal range between 0.31-5 pg/mL), whereas 377 out of 537 tests (70%) in the first half of 2020 alone are above 10 pg/mL (Figure 1 -Supplementary Figure 1). The distribution of observed IL-6 levels during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (mean = 68 pg/mL) is thus shifted towards higher levels compared to the IL-6 levels from earlier years (mean = 11 pg/mL). We also observed that IL-6 levels did not correlate with levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in the COVIDpospatients (Figure 1 -Supplementary Figure 2). Spurred by these observations, we were keen to analyze the retrospective real-world evidence regarding the use of plasma IL-6 levels to study the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. We were also intrigued by the availability of a smallcohort of patients with serial measurements of plasma IL-6 levels tied to the therapeutic regimen administered and clinical outcomes recorded in the associated EHRs.  A recent interim update from the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY) trial that is examining larger cohorts of severe COVID-19 patient outcomes revealed the  maximal  reduction  in  mortality  among  patients  treated  with  dexamethasone  over  other therapies8. In this trial, 2,104 randomized patients received 6 mg of dexamethasone once per day for ten days, compared with 4,321 patients that received standard care alone. Dexamethasone reduced mortality by one-third in ventilated patients (rate ratio 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88]; p=0.0003) and by one-fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only (0.80 [0.67 to 0.96]; p=0.0021)8.Although corticosteroids have long been utilized clinically for their immunosuppressive and  anti-inflammatory  capacities9,10,11,12the  precise  mechanisms  by  which  dexamethasone mediates clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 patients are not well understood. Indeed, the success of dexamethasone in treating COVID-19 was somewhat unexpected in light of an earlyreport during this pandemic urging clinicians to not prescribe corticosteroids for lung injury in COVID-19 patients, based on the lack of efficacy as well as elevated risk of adverse events associated  with  steroid  use  in  the  previous  SARS  and  MERS  epidemics13.  Such  ostensibly contradictory evidence and guidance underline the need for an improved mechanistic stratification of corticosteroid efficacy in different subsets of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Rapid advances in genomic and transcriptomic technologies over the past decade hold great potential to characterize drug targets at unprecedented levels. We recently released the nferX platform Single Cell application as a resource to help researchers analyze publicly deposited single cell RNA-sequencing datasets and readily contextualize these expression-derived insights using quantified literature associations14.

3data at single cell resolution to profile human tissues and cells based on their expression of ACE2, the putative entry receptor for SARS-CoV-214,15,16,17. Notably, although the primary glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) has been previously reported to be ubiquitously expressed18,19,20, the global expression profile of this important drug target has not been systematically evaluated across the hundreds of thousands of bulk RNA-seq samples and millions of single cell RNA-sequencing data points which are available. Here, we perform longitudinal analysis of real-worlddata and COVID-19 patients and triangulate  our  findings  with  publicly  available  transcriptomic  datasets  to  nominate  putative mechanisms by which dexamethasone results in reduced mortality. Our findings provide molecular support for the known immunomodulatory effects of corticosteroids and pinpoint the immune cell types which are most likely to be affected by systemic and pulmonary exposure to dexamethasone. Specifically  in  one  study  of  COVID-19  alveolar  immune  infiltrates21,  we  identify  multiple populations of macrophages which co-express NR3C1 and IL-6 genes, including one coexpressing population which tends to downregulate NR3C1 in severely ill patients compared to those with mild disease. We also find that non-immune cells including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells are among the cell types which most frequently coexpress these genes. Taken together, our findings provide initial molecular evidence to suggest that the clinical improvement observed with corticosteroid treatment may be due to NR3C1-mediated antagonism of IL-6 production both systemically and locally in the lungs. Our study warrants detailed follow-up  analyses  to  establish  the  clinical  efficacy  of  dexamethasone  and  other  corticosteroids  in COVID-19, and to identify molecular or cellular biomarkers associated with therapeutic responses. ResultsStratifying COVID-19 patients by ICU duration highlights IL-6 levels post administration of corticosteroids, but not non-corticosteroids, as an indicator of COVID-19 outcomesTo understand whether or not corticosteroids benefited inflammation-induced respiratory distress among the ICU patients, we started by characterizing respiratory status in patients who received corticosteroids and IL-6-testing versus those who received IL-6-testing alone. Among  COVID19 patients that were admitted to ICU at some point during their hospital stay and had undergone an IL-6 test, patients that were on corticosteroids experienced longer durations on higher levels of respiratory support compared to those that did not receive corticosteroids (Figure 1a). To  understand  how  corticosteroids  either  benefited  or  not  the  inflammation-induced respiratory distress among the ICU patients, we plotted plasma IL-6 levels versus ICU durations for  patientson  corticosteroid  and  non-corticosteroid  therapies  (antivirals,  azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab). Thresholds were set for IL-6 level (10 pg/mL) and ICU status (15 days) to group patients into four categories, with mortality grouped with ICU stay of 15 days  .

4or more. Among 16 patients with plasma IL-6 measurement post-corticosteroid administration (Figure  1b), a higher proportion of patients with an IL-6 value over 10 pg/mL have worse outcomes (i.e. ICU stay > 15 days or death) when compared to 41 patients treated with non-corticosteroid drugs (Figure 1c). The Fisher’s exact test p-value for this observation is 0.0024 (Figure 1d). The split-up of non-corticosteroid drugs into the specific therapeutics is also shown (Figure 1 -Supplementary Figure 3), with consistent observations to those summarized above.Longitudinal  comparison  of  plasma  IL-6  levels  pre-versus  post-administration  of corticosteroids The  timing  of  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  testing,  non-topical  corticosteroid  administration, tocilizumab  administration,  and  IL-6  measurements  available  for  63  hospitalized  COVID-19 patients are summarized in Figure 2-Supplementary Figure 1. Of these patients, we considered 10  critically  ill  COVID-19  patients  who  received  IL-6  plasma  tests  both  before  and  after corticosteroid administration. These patients met the following criteria: (1) hospitalized in the ICU for COVID-19 related illness, (2) received non-topical corticosteroid therapy during COVID-19 related hospitalization, and (3) underwent plasma IL-6 testing at least one time both before and after the first administration of a corticosteroid. Of these patients, 4/10 were male and the median age was 62 (interquartile range: 55-69). We found that IL-6 levels remained stable or decreased after steroid administration in 7 of 10 patients, while the remaining 3 patients showed large increases in IL-6. (Figure 2a). Nine of the 10 patients began with pre-corticosteroid IL-6 levels more than twice the upper limit of normal (normal reference range: 0.31-5 pg/mL). Following corticosteroid administration, 5 of the 10 patients returned to mean IL-6 levels less than twice the upper limit of normal (10 pg/mL) and 4 of the 10 patients had IL-6 levels less than 5 pg/mL. The was a weak correlation between change in average plasma IL-6 levels following corticosteroid administration and worse clinical outcomes (Figures 2b). However, an ICU duration of 15 days or more was not significantly associated with post-steroid increases in IL-6 (p-value = 0.17; Figure 2c). Thus, longitudinal IL-6 testing may be a useful biomarker for COVID-19 severity and resolution, but larger patient numbers would be required to confirm this hypothesis.Thecorticosteroid  target  NR3C1  is  strongly  expressed  across  hematopoietic  cell  types including in alveolar macrophages To better understand the mechanisms of potential corticosteroid-induced effects on IL-6 levels, we next systematically profiled the gene expression of NR3C1 -the highest affinity target of dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisone (Figure 3 -Supplementary Figure 1) -across over 450,000 human bulk RNA-sequencing samples from more than 10,000 studies. Such an  analysis  is  timely  and critical  to  identify  potential  mechanisms  of  steroid-induced immunomodulation. Indeed, the immunomodulatory function of corticosteroids has long been appreciated9,10, yet the expression profile of NR3C1 has not been formally established across all human tissues and cell types. The delineation of this profile in both healthy and diseased patients  .

5may help us to better understand the cell types which are most critical to mediate the beneficial effects of steroids in severely ill COVID-19 patients. We found that various immune cells -including T cells, B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages -are enriched  among  the  samples  with  the  highest  (top  5%)  of  NR3C1  expression  (Figure  3a), consistently with previously reported effects of glucocorticoids on the function of each of these cell types23,24,25,26,22. Interestingly, we also identified one study in which alveolar macrophages specifically showed high NR3C1 expression (Figure 3 -Supplementary Figure 2; n = 20 samples from 10 individuals), and we found that NR3C1 was consistently expressed at appreciable levels in alveolar macrophages from two other independent studies as well (Figure 3 -Supplementary Figure 2; n = 25 samples). We then further characterized NR3C1 expression by single cell RNA-sequencing across 1.9 million human cells using the nferX Single Cell platform14.  Consistent with our findings from bulk RNA-seq, we found that various hematopoietic lineages were enriched among the cells with highest expression of NR3C1 (Figure 3b). Several T cell populations showed particularly strong enrichment among NR3C1-high samples, but we also found evidence for high expression in macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, and innate lymphoid cells (Figure 3b). Similarly, in a study of peripheral blood samples from healthy donors (n = 6) and COVID-19 patients between days 2 and 16 of symptom onset (n = 7), NR3C1 was appreciably expressed in diverse immune cell types including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Figure 4). In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients, both macrophages and T cells strongly  expressed  NR3C1,  while  plasma  cells,  neutrophils,  and  the  recovered  epithelial populations showed lower levels of NR3C1 expression (Figure 5; nferX platform Single Cell app). NR3C1  and IL-6  are  co-expressed  in  alveolar  macrophages  of  COVID-19  patients  and systemically in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cellsTo connect this expression profile to our clinical observation of reduced plasma IL-6 in a subset of patients following corticosteroid administration, we specifically evaluated co-expression of  NR3C1  and  IL-6  across  these  same  1.9  million  human  single  cells.  We  found  that  two populations of alveolar macrophages from a study of healthy controls (n = 3) and COVID-19 patients (n = 9)were among the most strongly enriched cell types for this co-expression, with both genes detected in 20% and 5% of these two populations (“Macrophages 4” and “Macrophages 1”, respectively; Figure 6a).  Interestingly, in contrast to the immune-centric expression profile of NR3C1 alone, we found that several other non-immune cell types showed notable co-expression with IL6 in both respiratory (Figure  6b)and non-respiratory(Figure  6c-d)tissues including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, andsmooth muscle cells. This observation of co-expression in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells is particularly interesting given the reports of systemic vascular inflammation in the context of COVID-1927–29. Given the well-established  mechanisms  of  glucocorticoid-mediated  suppression  of  IL-6  transcription30,  we propose that agonism of NR3C1 in these various co-expressing cell types serves to dampen IL-6 production both in the lungs and systemically.  .

6In severe COVID-19 patients, NR3C1 is downregulated in macrophages that co-express IL-6 and NR3C1Given  that  dexamethasone  appears  to  reduce  mortality  among  only  severe  cases  of COVID-19, we finally asked how NR3C1 and IL-6 co-expression varies between mild and severe disease.  To  answer  this,  we  assessed  NR3C1  and  IL-6  expression  levels  in  each  recovered bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell population between cases of mild COVID-19 (n = 3) and severe COVID-19 (n = 6), along with healthy controls (n = 3). Interestingly we found that expression of IL-6 and NR3C1 is positively correlated in the strongest co-expressing population (“Macrophages 4” identified above), and further thatNR3C1 expression in this cell population was significantly lower in patients with severe compared to mild disease (Figures 7a-b). We hypothesize that this overall direct correlation may reflect a cell-intrinsic mechanism wherein activated inflammatory macrophages are simultaneously primed for homeostatic steroid-mediated immunosuppression. Indeed, such programmed feedback loops are well-established to dampen immune responses, including most notably the immune checkpoint pathways (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1) which  restrain  excessive  T-cell  activation  upon  antigen  recognition31.  Accordingly,  our observation that NR3C1 expression is decreased in severe COVID-19 patients compared to mild COVID-19  patients  may  reflect a  pathologic  downregulation  of  this  endogenous immunomodulatory system which can be restored pharmacologically via corticosteroid-mediated agonism of NR3C1. Together with potential broader effects exerted through the various other previously identified NR3C1/IL-6 co-expressing cell types (see Figure 7), corticosteroid therapy may thereby dampen both local pulmonary and systemic inflammation to reduce the likelihood of patient progression to outright cytokine storm. DiscussionThe COVID-19 pandemic is unquestionably one of the most urgent global health crises of the modern era. Its onset and dissemination around the world has sparked clinical and basic research in efforts to discover interventions which can effectively eliminate infection or mitigate the clinical course of disease progression. While antiviral drugs, antibiotics, and antimalarial have shown little to no clinical benefit in COVID-19 patients32,33,34, modulation of host inflammatory responses with drugs that inhibit IL-6 signaling (tocilizumab) or stimulate glucocorticoid receptor activity  (dexamethasone)  have  been  shown  to  improve clinical  outcomes  in  critically  ill patients6,35. This is consistent with the recent establishment of IL-6 as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity5.Along these lines, a summary of the ICD-10 codes enriched among patients with high plasma IL-6 levels in 2019 included “Nonspecific Abnormal Finding of the Lung” whereas those enriched in 2020 include “Acute Respiratory Failure with Hypoxia” and “COVID-19 Infection”. This highlights the strong clinical association between high IL-6 levels and severe COVID-19 infection,  and  motivates  better  understanding  of  whether  the  suggested  clinical  benefit  of corticosteroid therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients may be related to their established ability  .

7to reduce the transcriptional expression of IL-6 and other inflammatory mediators in various cell types22. In this study, we performed an integrated analysis of publicly available molecular data and curated EHR data as well as associated lab test results to study mechanisms of corticosteroid mitigation of COVID-19 cytokine storms and ARDS. Strikingly, despite the long history of corticosteroid use in the clinic, expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) has never been systematically profiled at single-cell resolution in the modern genomic era. Such a profiling will help understand the tissues and cell types which are most likely to be directly targetedby systemic steroid therapies. Consistent with the well-established and clinically utilized anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids, our analysis of gene expression by bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing strongly  suggests  that  hematopoietic  cells  arethe  cells  most  prominently  impacted  by  the corticosteroid dexamethasone via its NR3C1 agonism. Specifically, we find that T cells are the most strongly enriched human cell type for high NR3C1 expression, but other adaptive and innate immune cells are alsonotably strong expressors. After  NR3C1,  the  second  highest  affinity  target  known  for  the  corticosteroid dexamethasone  is  NR3C2,  which  was  not  explored  in  this  study.  Primarily,  the  intersection between IL6 and NR3C2 appears to be limited to the ovaries (Figure 3 -Supplementary Figure 3). The NR3C2 activity of corticosteroids, and indeed the other targets including progesterone receptors, may well be beneficial for other aspects of COVID-19 severity mitigation beyond the IL-6  cytokine  nexus  that  was  explored  in  this  study  via  clinical-omics  triangulation.  The polypharmacology of corticosteroids as they pertain to COVID-19 will be the topic of a follow-up study.To understand the cellular context around the intersection of glucocorticoids and IL-6, in thisstudy, we have performed the first directed co-expression analysis of NR3C1 and IL-6 across human single cell RNA-sequencing datasets totaling almost 2 million cells. Interestingly, this analysis highlighted that while NR3C1 alone is highly expressed in Tcells throughout the human body, co-expression with IL-6 is prominently observed in alveolar macrophages of the lung along with various non-immune cells across multiple tissues including endothelial, smooth muscle, epithelial, and stromal cells. We hypothesize that the engagement of the glucocorticoid receptor by dexamethasone in these co-expressing cell types reduces local and systemic IL-6 production, which in turn restores immune homeostasis and mitigates the progression of the COVID-19 associated acuterespiratory distress syndrome. In support of this hypothesis, our analysis of EHR data from a large academic medical center shows that plasma IL-6 levels are reduced after steroid administration in a subset of critically ill COVID-19 patients, and patients with this steroid-associated IL-6 decline tend to have shorter ICU admissions than patients whose IL-6 levels increase even after steroid administration. It is important to note that other inflammatory pathways are also notably activated -and excessively so -in COVID-19 patients and that blockade of these pathways may provide clinical benefit similar to that seen with tocilizumab. For example, early results indicate that blockade of  .

8the GM-CSF pathway with the monoclonal antibody mavrilimumab may improve outcomes in several ill patients. GM-CSF is known to orchestrate the activity of various innate immune cells including dendritic cells36and macrophages36, and single cell RNA-seq data confirms that NR3C1 is co-expressed with both the alpha and beta subunits of the GM-CSF receptor (CSF2RA and CSF2Rb) in several macrophage populations from the BALF of COVID-19 patients (Figure 7c). Whether agonism of the glucocorticoid signaling pathway in these cells impacts their response to GM-CSF  is  certainly  relevant  to  investigate  as  this  could  have  direct  clinical  implications regarding  the  utility  of  coadministration  of  corticosteroids  with  both  tocilizumab  and mavrilimumab. The results reported in this study emphasize that follow-up studies with larger cohorts of longitudinal data are warranted to investigate the clinical efficacy of dexamethasone and other corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients with ARDS and CRS. Such larger follow-up studies will help  shed  light  on  the  mechanisms  underlying  heterogeneity  in  patient  responsiveness  to corticosteroids. If suppression of IL-6 production by corticosteroids like dexamethasone is indeed confirmed to be responsible for mitigating the respiratory and vascular onslaught of SARS-CoV-2 in severely ill COVID-19 patients, then longitudinal monitoring of plasma IL-6 levels before and after initiation of steroids may be warranted in clinical practice. Such practice will help determine whether a patient is likely to respond to corticosteroid therapy alone or if they should be considered as candidates for alternative intervention, including combination therapies with IL-6 receptor antagonists like Tocilizumab (Actemra) and Sarilumab (Kevzara), or direct IL-6 antibodies like Siltuximab (Sylvant).MethodsCohort definition for patients receiving IL-6 measurements and corticosteroidsAll patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COVIDpos), as determined by at least one positive PCR test, within the Mayo Clinic Health System and were hospitalized were selected as candidates for further analysis. These COVIDpospatients were then filtered by requiring an administration  of  a  systemic  corticosteroid  at  some  point  during  their  hospital  stay;  these corticosteroids  included  dexamethasone,  prednisone,  triamcinolone,  methylprednisolone, prednisolone, betamethasone, and hydrocortisone. Tocilizumab was also included as a control given it’s known effect on IL-6 signaling. In patients whoreceived a systemic corticosteroid, we required that they underwent plasma IL-6 testing at least once both before and after the first administration of any of the corticosteroid agents listed above. Only 13 patients met these criteria, with  7  patients  receiving  IL-6  testing  before  and  after  methylprednisolone  administration,  4 patients receiving IL-6 testing before and after prednisone administration, and 4 patients receiving IL-6 testing before and after hydrocortisone administration. 2 patients overlapped drug categories, with one receiving first administrations of both methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone between IL-6 tests and the other receiving first administrations of both prednisone and hydrocortisone  .

9between IL-6 tests). In total, six patients received IL-6 testing both before and after any first corticosteroid administration within the timeframe considered (-25 days to +64 days). In addition to IL-6 levels and corticosteroid/tocilizumab administration data, we extracted outcomes including death, admission to an ICU, and length of time in ICU, as well as demographic information such as age, sex, and race.For patients with IL-6 measured post-corticosteroid administration, over half of the patients (11 out of 21) were in the ICU at least 15 days or did not survive and had IL-6 levels above 10 pg/mL. As a corollary, fewer patients given corticosteroids (30%, n=21) had high IL-6 levels and shorter  ICU  stays  compared  to  tocilizumab  (80%,  n=5),  azithromycin  (61%,  n=49),  and hydroxychloroquine (60%, n=10).While not statistically significant due to small cohort sizes, together these results may indicate that patients with high IL-6 levels post-corticosteroids are more likely to have longer ICU durations compared to the other drugs considered here. This points to the  necessity  for  IL-6  measurement  post-corticosteroid  administration  to  monitor  if  further intervention is needed. Characterizing the survival curves of hospitalized and ICU COVID-19 patientsKaplan-Meier  curves  were  generated  for  185  COVID-19  positive  patients  that  were hospitalized at the Mayo Clinic (Figure 8). Patient cohorts were defined by each drug or drug class that was administered. Patients receiving multiple drugs of different classes were counted as part of both cohorts. The drugs analyzed include corticosteroids, antivirals (remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir), antibacterial azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab. As shown,  all  11  hospitalized  patients  receiving  tocilizumab  survived  60  days  post  diagnosis. Hospitalized cohorts receiving corticosteroids (n=95) and azithromycin (n=123) have similar survival rates between 90-95% when considering all hospitalized patients. Hydroxychloroquine (n=21) also has a 60-day post-diagnosis survival rate of 90%, but compared to corticosteroids and azithromycin, mortality occurred much earlier in the hydroxychloroquine cohort, i.e. 2 out of 21 patients died within 5 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. However, when considering more severe COVID patients requiring ICU admission, this subset of hydroxychloroquine patients (n=11) have a 100% survival rate, the azithromycin cohort (n=64) remains relatively unchanged (92% vs. 93% for all hospitalized patients), and the corticosteroid cohort survival rate decreased from 91% to 84% at 60 days post-diagnosis. In both hospitalized and ICU patient cohorts, antivirals performed most poorly, with the caveat that these cohorts also have the smallest patient counts. Similar trends were also observed in the subset of patients with IL-6 measurements in these cohorts.To further understand the specific effects of the different corticosteroids given to COVID positive  patients,  survival  rates  of  hospitalized  and  ICU  patients  given  dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, prednisone and methylprednisolone were also generated. For hospitalized patients, dexamethasone (n=30) and prednisone (n=39) perform similarly (90% and 92% 60-day survival, respectively) and have higher 60-day survival post-diagnosis compared to hydrocortisone (n=34) and methylprednisolone (n=22) (79%and 77% 60-day survival, respectively).

Such a profiling will help understand the tissues and cell types which are most likely to be directly targetedby systemic steroid therapies. Consistent with the well-established and clinically utilized anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids, our analysis of gene expression by bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing strongly  suggests  that  hematopoietic  cells  arethe  cells  most  prominently  impacted  by  the corticosteroid dexamethasone via its NR3C1 agonism. Specifically, we find that T cells are the most strongly enriched human cell type for high NR3C1 expression, but other adaptive and innate immune cells are alsonotably strong expressors. After  NR3C1,  the  second  highest  affinity  target  known  for  the  corticosteroid dexamethasone  is  NR3C2,  which  was  not  explored  in  this  study.  Primarily,  the  intersection between IL6 and NR3C2 appears to be limited to the ovaries (Figure 3 -Supplementary Figure 3). The NR3C2 activity of corticosteroids, and indeed the other targets including progesterone receptors, may well be beneficial for other aspects of COVID-19 severity mitigation beyond the IL-6  cytokine  nexus  that  was  explored  in  this  study  via  clinical-omics  triangulation.  The polypharmacology of corticosteroids as they pertain to COVID-19 will be the topic of a follow-up study.To understand the cellular context around the intersection of glucocorticoids and IL-6, in thisstudy, we have performed the first directed co-expression analysis of NR3C1 and IL-6 across human single cell RNA-sequencing datasets totaling almost 2 million cells. Interestingly, this analysis highlighted that while NR3C1 alone is highly expressed in Tcells throughout the human body, co-expression with IL-6 is prominently observed in alveolar macrophages of the lung along with various non-immune cells across multiple tissues including endothelial, smooth muscle, epithelial, and stromal cells. We hypothesize that the engagement of the glucocorticoid receptor by dexamethasone in these co-expressing cell types reduces local and systemic IL-6 production, which in turn restores immune homeostasis and mitigates the progression of the COVID-19 associated acuterespiratory distress syndrome. In support of this hypothesis, our analysis of EHR data from a large academic medical center shows that plasma IL-6 levels are reduced after steroid administration in a subset of critically ill COVID-19 patients, and patients with this steroid-associated IL-6 decline tend to have shorter ICU admissions than patients whose IL-6 levels increase even after steroid administration. It is important to note that other inflammatory pathways are also notably activated -and excessively so -in COVID-19 patients and that blockade of these pathways may provide clinical benefit similar to that seen with tocilizumab. For example, early results indicate that blockade of  .

8the GM-CSF pathway with the monoclonal antibody mavrilimumab may improve outcomes in several ill patients. GM-CSF is known to orchestrate the activity of various innate immune cells including dendritic cells36and macrophages36, and single cell RNA-seq data confirms that NR3C1 is co-expressed with both the alpha and beta subunits of the GM-CSF receptor (CSF2RA and CSF2Rb) in several macrophage populations from the BALF of COVID-19 patients (Figure 7c). Whether agonism of the glucocorticoid signaling pathway in these cells impacts their response to GM-CSF  is  certainly  relevant  to  investigate  as  this  could  have  direct  clinical  implications regarding  the  utility  of  coadministration  of  corticosteroids  with  both  tocilizumab  and mavrilimumab. The results reported in this study emphasize that follow-up studies with larger cohorts of longitudinal data are warranted to investigate the clinical efficacy of dexamethasone and other corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients with ARDS and CRS. Such larger follow-up studies will help  shed  light  on  the  mechanisms  underlying  heterogeneity  in  patient  responsiveness  to corticosteroids. If suppression of IL-6 production by corticosteroids like dexamethasone is indeed confirmed to be responsible for mitigating the respiratory and vascular onslaught of SARS-CoV-2 in severely ill COVID-19 patients, then longitudinal monitoring of plasma IL-6 levels before and after initiation of steroids may be warranted in clinical practice. Such practice will help determine whether a patient is likely to respond to corticosteroid therapy alone or if they should be considered as candidates for alternative intervention, including combination therapies with IL-6 receptor antagonists like Tocilizumab (Actemra) and Sarilumab (Kevzara), or direct IL-6 antibodies like Siltuximab (Sylvant).","Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality in severe COVID-19 patients are driven  by  “cytokine  storms”  and  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS).  Interim clinical trial results suggest that the corticosteroid dexamethasone displays superior 28-day survival in severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation or oxygen. Among 16 patients with plasma IL-6 measurement post-corticosteroid administration, a higher proportion of patients with an IL-6 value over 10 pg/mL have worse outcomes (i.e. ICU Length of Stay > 15  days  or  death)  when  compared  to  41  patients  treated  with  non-corticosteroid  drugs including antivirals, tocilizumab, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine (p-value = 0.0024). Given  this  unexpected  clinical  association  between  post-corticosteroid  IL-6  levels  and COVID-19 severity, we hypothesized that the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR or NR3C1) may be coupled to IL-6 expression in specific cell types that govern cytokine release syndrome (CRS).  Examining  single  cell  RNA-seq  data  from  bronchoalveolar  lavage  fluid  of  severe COVID-19 patients and nearly 2 million human cells from a pan-tissue scan shows that alveolar macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells co-express both NR3C1 and IL-6. The mechanism of Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) agonists mitigating pulmonary and multi-organ inflammation in some COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure, may be in part due to their successful antagonism of IL-6 production within lung macrophages and vasculature."
Anemia is a risk factor for rehospitalization after SARS-CoV-2 clearance,"Background:As the number of new and recovering COVID-19 cases continues to rise, it has become evident that patients can experience symptoms and complications after viral clearance. Clinical biomarkers characterizing patients who are likely to experience these prolonged effects are unknown. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to compare longitudinal lab test measurements (hemoglobin, hematocrit, estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen) in patients rehospitalized after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 clearance (n=104) versus patients not rehospitalized after viral clearance (n=278).Findings: Compared to patients who were not rehospitalized after PCR-confirmed viral clearance, those who were rehospitalized had lower median hemoglobin levels in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (cohen’s D = -0.50; p=1.2x10-3) and during the active infection window (cohen’s D = -0.71; p=4.6x10-8). Patients hospitalized after viral clearance were also more likely to be diagnosed with moderate orsevere anemia during the active infection window (OR = 2.18; p = 4.99x10-9). Conclusions: The occurrence of moderate or severe anemia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is strongly associated with rehospitalization after viral clearance. Whether interventions to mitigate anemia can improve long term outcomes of COVID-19 patients should be further investigated. Funding: This study was funded by nference. .

While efforts early in the pandemic rightly focused on the acute lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2, the subsequent realization that COVID-19 may have more lasting effects has mandated a better understanding of factors that predispose patients to experience long-term COVID-19 related complications. We have previously sought to address this knowledge gap using state-of-the-art NLP models deployed on a complete EHR system (Pawlowski et al., 2020), and here we have expanded this effort to include the longitudinal analysis of laboratory measurements both prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and during active SARS-CoV-2 infection. This lab test analysis shows that anemia and renal function in the pre-COVID and SARS-CoV-2+phases are associated with the risk of post viral clearance hospitalization. Our logistic regression analyses suggest that AKI and static renal lab measurements are not independently associated with rehospitalization, with ICU admission during COVID-19 infection representing a likely confounding factor contributing to the observed trends. Indeed, AKI has previously been reported as a common morbidity in ICU patients (Mohsenin, 2017) and was observed frequently among ICU admitted COVID-19 patients in our cohort, with 78% (94/121) and 39% (47/121) of ICU admitted patients experiencing stage 1+ and stage 2+ AKI, respectively.  On theother hand, hemoglobin  levels  and  the  outright  diagnosis  of  moderate  or  severe  anemia  are  robustly associated with post-clearance rehospitalization independent of sex, number of blood draws, and ICU admission status. While the pathophysiologic foundations for these associations are not yet clear, the findings do merit consideration in the context of COVID-19 clinical care. Indeed, pre-existing conditions are already integrated in the clinical decision-making algorithms around COVID-19 as the Center for Diseases Control (CDC) has designated various chronic conditions as risk factors  .

for  severe  COVID-19  infection  (e.g.  cancer,  chronic  kidney  disease,  chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes) (CDC, 2020). However, there is much less known regarding factors or conditions that place people at risk for subsequent complications such as rehospitalization after viral clearance. Once identified, such factors and conditions should similarly be incorporated into the clinical decision-making process when treating COVID-19 patients. Our finding that lower hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and the outright diagnosis of moderate or severe anemia, prior to or during active SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with post viral clearance hospitalization has not been previously reported. And while sickle cell disease is considered a risk factor for severe COVID-19, anemia itself is not considered to be such a risk factor. While a causal role for anemia in post clearance hospitalization is certainly not established by this analysis, the robust association warrants further studies to determine the whether anemia mitigating therapies (e.g., vitamin or mineral supplementation, erythropoietin administration, or blood transfusion) engender long-term benefits in select COVID-19 patients. Further, even if mitigation of anemia does not impact subsequent hospitalization, these links between anemia and COVID-19 are interesting in light of several previous lines of research. First,  several  groups  have  reported  an  association  between  blood  groups  and susceptibility to or severity of COVID-19 infection (Latz et  al., 2020, Ellinghaus et  al., 2020). Specifically, it has been suggested that individuals with type O blood may be at lower risk for contracting COVID-19 or experiencing respiratory failure in the context of COVID-19. Whether this association reflects a direct or indirect interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and erythrocytes is not known, but it could certainly be relevant to pursue whether blood type is also associated with the occurrence or severity of anemia in the setting of COVID-19.Second, fatigue has been commonly reported as both an acute symptom and a lasting effect of COVID-19 (Wagner et al., 2020, Pascarella et al., 2020, Townsend et al., 2020), but the  .

mechanisms underlying this phenotype have not been established. It is worth noting that 295 of the 374 (79%) hospitalized COVID-19 patients in this study had at least mild anemia during their SARS-CoV-2+phase, and 140 of the 374 (37%) patients had moderateor severe anemia (defined as hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) during this interval. It would be worthwhile to perform a longitudinal follow-up on these patients to determine whether they continue to experience anemia in the months following SARS-CoV-2 clearance, andwhether the presence of such a post-COVID anemia is associated with reports of fatigue. Along with our previous analysis (Pawlowski et al., 2020), this study illustrates the value of deploying sophisticated platforms across EHR systems that enable the integrated analysis of diverse data types including sentiment-laden text and laboratory test measurements. Taken together, these studies provide the first example of leveraging augmented curation methods to first identify phenotypes that distinguish defined clinical cohorts and to then cross check these phenotypic associations through a hypothesis-driven analysis of the most relevant lab tests. This framework can be effectively scaled for other clinical research efforts not only in COVID-19 but also in any other disease areas of interest. .

Limitations of the StudyThis study has several important limitations to consider. First, this analysis considers only patients within one EHR system; while this system does contain patient data from multiple sites of clinical care in distinct geographic locations (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida), there are still likely underlying biases in important factors such as patient demographics and tendencies around the ordering of laboratory tests by clinicians. Such biases would prevent the studied cohort and their associated data points from serving as true representative samples of all COVID-19 patients. Second, the analyzed cohort was relatively small (n = 382) as most patients diagnosed with COVID-19 do not subsequently receive two confirmatory negative PCR tests, and only a subset of these 382 patients possessed data for each lab test of interest. Finally, the definition of the SARS-CoV-2+window is imperfect as the true date of viral clearance for a given patient would likely precede their first negative PCR test by an unknown amount of time.","Background:As the number of new and recovering COVID-19 cases continues to rise, it has become evident that patients can experience symptoms and complications after viral clearance.

Long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA Shedding and its Temporal Association to IgG Seropositivity,"Analysis  of  851 COVID-19 patients  with aSARS-CoV-2-positive  PCR  at  follow-upshows99   patients   remainedSARS-CoV-2-positive   after fourweeksfrom   initial diagnosis.Surprisingly, a  majority of  these  long-term viral  RNA shedders  were  not hospitalized(61  of  99),with variable PCR  Crossing  point  values overthe month postdiagnosis. For the 851-patient cohort, the mean lower bound of viral RNA shedding was 17.3 days (SD:7.8), and the mean upper bound of viral RNA shedding from 668 patientstransitioning  to  confirmed  PCR-negative  status  was  22.7  days  (SD: 11.8). Among  104 patients with  anIgG  testresult,  90  patients  were  seropositive  to  date,  with  mean  upper bound of time to seropositivity from initial diagnosis being37.8 days (95%CI: 34.3-41.3). Juxtaposing  IgG/PCR tests revealed that 14 of  90  patients  are non-hospitalizedandseropositive yetshed viral RNA.This study emphasizesthe need for monitoring viral loadsandneutralizing antibodytitersin long-term shedders.IntroductionAs COVID-19 continues to rage globally with over 11 million confirmed infected individuals and 500,000 deaths1, the world is grappling with the dual challenge of stemming the tide of the current pandemic and planning for reopening the economy in the post-COVID phase. Currently, there are over a million patients that have recovered from COVID-191, and some governments have suggested that antibody-based tests in recovered individuals can be used as the basis for an “immunity passport”2to travel or return-to-work assuming that they are protected against re-infection and likely not infectious. However, there are also emerging reports of viral shedding for many days post-recovery, as evidenced from PCR tests on stool samples3and recurrent SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR tests in “cured” patients4. In addition to routine RT-PCR assays that are the gold standard for COVID-19 clinical diagnosis, recent studies have suggested droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) as a more sensitive assay for quantifying viral load in early infection stages5,6. The crossing point (Cp) values from SARS- .

2CoV-2 RT-PCR assays has also been correlated with culture positivity to suggest that Cp values above 33-34 may no longer be associated with replication competent virus7.The general lack of understanding of the period of infectivity, viral shedding, and potential for  transmission  necessitates  longitudinal  monitoring  of  viral  clearance  in  COVID-19  patients. Such an analysis has the potential to help inform the immunological basis for rapid viral control and disease progression.ResultsBetween February and June 2020, 131,646 individuals underwent routine SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing at the Mayo Clinic hospitals in Minnesota, Arizona and Florida, and the associated Mayo Clinic Health System (Figure 1a). Of these, 27,309 individuals (21%) were subjected to the PCR test more than once (Figure 1a). Of all the individuals tested, 5,699 patients tested SARS-CoV-2-positive (henceforth, COVIDpos) at least once during the study period (Figure 1b). The age distributions in the context of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality status are shown for COVIDpos patients in Figure 1c-f. Notably, over 50% of the COVIDpospatients in this study are in the age group of 0-40. The pattern of increased hospitalization, ICU admissions and death in the elderly compared to the younger populations is consistent with previous studies of COVID-19 patient demographics8–10.Among the 5,699 COVIDpospatients, 2,126 patients (37.3%) were subjected to two or more PCR tests, and 851 patients (14.9%) had at least two SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR tests (Figure 1b,g). We observed 203 patients oscillated from SARS-CoV-2-positive to SARS-CoV-2-negative and back to SARS-CoV-2-positive status one or more times (Figure 1h). Given such oscillation potential,we henceforth consider a pair of contiguous SARS-CoV-2 negative PCR tests after the last positive PCR test to be indicative of a ‘confirmed COVID-19 negative’ status. Despite  the  caveat  of  routine  RT-PCR  assays  not  providing  data  on  the  replication competency of the virus, the availability of these longitudinal PCR test results and the patients’ Electronic Health Records (EHRs), provides an excellent opportunity to quantify the duration of SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR results. Specifically, we aimed to quantify for each patient –(1) alower bound of infection duration, definedas the time in days between the first and last positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, and (2) an upper bound of infection duration, definedas the time in days between the first positive PCR test and the second negative PCR test after which there are no further positive PCR tests (Figure 2a). The lower bound captures the most intuitive estimate of infection duration, at least from the standpoint of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. Nevertheless, our quantification of the upper bound is motivated by recent reports of high false-negative rates for SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests11, our own observation of oscillations in serial PCR testing outcomes (Figure 1h), and the requirement for healthcare workers to observe negative PCR results on two consecutive days to meet the CDC “Return to Work” criteria8. COVID-19 patients whose lower bound of infection durationis greater than four weeks (28 days) are hereafter referred to as patients with ‘long-term shedding of viral RNA’. For the 668 COVIDpospatients that switched to a confirmed negative status, i.e. two negative SARS-CoV-2  .

3PCR tests following the last positive SARS-CoV-2 test, the distribution of the upper bound of infection duration was a mean of 22.8 days and a standard deviation of 11.8 days (Figure 2b). Of the 851 COVIDpospatients with at least two PCR positive results, interestingly, 231 patients (27%)and 99 patients (11.6%) have viral RNA shedding beyond 21 days and 28 days of initial diagnosis, respectively (Figure 2c). Strikingly, in both cases the majority of these patients are not hospitalized; i.e. 158 of 231 patients (68.4%, in the 21+ days category) and 61 of 99 patients (61.6%, in the 28+ days category). Of  104  COVIDpospatients  with  available  SARS-CoV-2  IgG  serology  data, 14  patients remain either serology negative or indeterminatetill date.Of theremnant90 patientswho are seroconverted till date, the upper bound of time to IgG-seropositivity from initial PCR diagnostic testing has a mean of 37.8 days (95% confidence interval: 34.3-41.3 days; Figure 3a). Here, we consider this analysis an “upper bound”, rather than a definitive time to seropositivity, as each patient may have experienced IgG seroconversion prior to the date when the serology test was actually  administered.  Based  on  the  limited  longitudinal  real-world  data  available  for  IgG seropositivity, this upper bound is the best estimate we are able to obtain at this juncture. Next, we juxtaposed the SARS-CoV-2 PCR results against the IgG-seropositivity results for 90 COVID-19 patients with both sets of longitudinal data (Figure 3b). Surprisingly, 14 of these patients  had  viral  RNA  shedding  between  0  to  64  days  after  their  confirmed  date  of  IgG-seropositivity (Figure 3c). The finding that the time to IgG seropositivity can be shorter than the lower  bound  of  positive  PCR  tests  in  some  patients,  suggests  that  COVID-19  patients  can continue to shed viral RNA for days or even weeks while generating IgG antibodies. Long-term SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR tests are notnecessarily indicative of long-term replication-competent  virus.12,13Consequently,  we  evaluated  488  SARS-CoV-2-positive  PCR test’s Crossing point (Cp) values from nasopharyngeal swab samples of 208 patients. Among these, the mean Cp value was 28.6 with a standard deviation of 5 (Figure 4a). From 63 patients with viral RNA shedding beyond 21 days of initial diagnosis, the distribution of Cp values showed a mean of 31.87 and standard deviation of 1.14 (Figure  4b). In a subset of 17 patients who demonstrated longer-term viral RNA shedding beyond 28 days of initial diagnosis, the Cp values had a mean of 31.93 with a standard deviation of 1.22 (Figure 4c). The overall decreased mean Cp value across all compiled positive PCR tests relative to the long-term shedder’s PCR test Cp values, implies a smaller amount of viral RNA available for amplification in the swab samples from long-term shedders (post 21 and 28 days of initial diagnosis). DiscussionA recent study from China of 74 COVIDpospatient’s fecal samples and respiratory swabs observed SARS-CoV-2-positive swabs with a mean duration of 15.4 days and standard deviation of 6.7 days from the first symptom onset15. In this study, we have shown that COVID-19 patients that are long-term shedders are predominantly not hospitalized, thus underlining the importance  .

4of understanding the temporal dynamics of viral load, the duration of infectivity, and the likelihood of community transmission. Studies focusing on the temporal profiles of viral shedding suggest that the viral loads are highest at symptom onset, and subsequently decrease over the following 21 day13,16and that live virus could no longer be cultured after day 8, leading to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness may decline from the time of symptom onset12,13. Whether such experimental results are generalizable to allCOVID-19 patients that are long-term shedders is an important follow-up question. Based on a recent study that characterized SARS-CoV-2 viral replication as a function of RT-PCR  Cpvalues,attempting  a  characterization  of488  PCR  tests  from  208  SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in our study,7would suggestpercentage of positive cultures of mean 49.2% andstandard deviation 23.7% (Figure  4 -Supplementary  Figure  1a). Likewise, extrapolating the corresponding distribution of percentage of positive culture values in the 63 patients with viral RNA shedding beyond 21 days based on the last positive PCR tests would have mean of 33.3% and  standard  deviation  of  7.6%  (Figure  4 -Supplementary  Figure  1b),  while  these  figures beyond the 28 days threshold would have mean of 33.6% and standard deviation of 8.2% (Figure 4 -Supplementary  Figure  1c). Given it  is  impossible  to  effectively  apply  the  relationship garnered  between  Cp  values  and  positive  cultures  from  different published RT-PCR  assaystowards thisstudy, positive culture characterization for our RT-PCR assay would involve a follow-up investigation that incorporates longitudinal viral load assessments. Although  the  SARS-CoV-2-positive  RT-PCR  tests  by  no  means  causally  implicate replication-competent virus, the presence of viral RNA for several weeks from initial infection certainly  warrants  longitudinal  monitoring  of  the  viral  load5,7.  Nonetheless,  the  question  still remains as to why some COVIDpospatients harbor virus or viral RNA for far longer than other COVIDpospatients. Our observations regarding non-hospitalized, IgG-seropositive, long-term viral RNA shedders highlights the need for follow-up studies to study the neutralizing potential for antibodies  generated  by  long-term  shedders  and  contextualize  such  analysis  vis-a-vis  direct assessment of viral loads and more quantitative assays such as ddPCR.5,6The assessment of whether any of the IgG and IgM antibodies generated are able to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins (spike, envelope, membrane) or the nucleocapsid protein14would add an immunological lens to interpret the seroconversion upper bounds noted in this  study.  Taken  together,  such  additional  research  would  help  inform  whether  current  CDC guidelines of 10 days self-quarantining for asymptomatic patients may be broadly satisfactory, including for patients that are noted to be long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedders8.Several  factors  could  influence  the  persistent  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  positive status. Replicative fitness of a given virus is one of them. For instance, in HIV, not all viruses replicate equivalently, and differences may be attributable in part to polymorphisms in different genes18. For  SARS-CoV-2,  there  are  reports  of  different  polymorphisms  that  have  been  speculated  to impact disease severity or transmissibility, such as the D164G mutation in the spike (S) protein19. Another  factor  that  may  influence  the  persistence  of  PCR  positivity  could  be  the  timing  and robustness of the immune response. For example, given the role of the IFN response in viral shedding20, early IFN response is likely to be beneficial and reduce shedding, whereas late IFN  .

5response may be deleterious and delay clearance. Another potential factor to consider is the T cell  response21.  When  T cells  express  high  levels  of  different  effector  mechanisms  (e.g. Perforin/granzyme B, IFN), they are thought to work better than if they produce only one effector pathway.It may be noted that the clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests has been debated to some extent17, and certainly there are anecdotal examples from our own clinic experience where critical ill COVID-19 patients can switch from a COVIDposstatus to a COVIDnegstatus within a short period of time. To robustly enable scientific assessment of the sensitivity of the routine RT-PCR testing data analyzed here, we summarized the entire pattern of serial PCR outcomes across the 5,569 COVID-19 patients in this study. This analysis shows that the vast majority of the  COVID-19  patients  subjected  to  our  RT-PCR  assays  do  produce  consistent  results,  as determined by multiple contiguous PCR tests resulting in the same outcome. There is a small minority of COVID-19 patients where aberrant switching of PCR results is indeed observed, with the underlying reasons undetermined at this juncture. In order to understand whether long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedders display any other distinctive features from the structured EHR, we defined a control cohort ofCOVID-19 patients with an upper bound of infection duration between 1 to 13 days (“short-term shedders”). We compared the long-term shedders with this control cohort by analyzing the counts of over 15,000 features  constituting  the  fields  of  structured  EHRdatabases,  including  diagnosis,  ICD  codes, medication history, immunization records, procedures, and demographics (see Methods). We do not find any significant distinguishing clinical features for long-term shedders compared to short-term  shedders  across multiple  scenarios:  (1)  all  patients,  features  from  last  90  days  ,  (2)  all patients, features from after diagnosis, (3) all patients, features from 21 days after diagnosis, (4) all patients, features from 28 days after diagnosis, (5) non-hospitalized patients, features from last 90 days, (6) non-hospitalized patients, features from 21 days after diagnosis, (7) non-hospitalized patients, features from 28 days after diagnosis, and (8) non-hospitalized patients, features from diagnosis date.While this preliminary observation from structured EHR counts has to be monitored as more COVID-19 patients’ longitudinal lab results are available, at this juncture, it appears that the majority  of  long-term  shedders  are  non-hospitalized  patients  with  likely  mild  or  moderate symptoms that do not prompt their detailed clinical follow-up. Given that some of these long-term viral RNA shedders are already seropositive when they continue shedding, suggests that we cannot yet rely on IgG or any other antibody responsealone to estimate immunity or odds of re-infection  potential  with  SARS-CoV-2  without  investigating  the  salience  of  long-term  RNA shedding. The fact thatreplication-competent virus in some of these long-term RNA shedders cannot be ruled out based on the data available from PCR Ct values, underlines the need for prolonged monitoring of viral loads and immune responses in such COVID-19 patients. Our  findings  raise  important  additional  follow-up  questions  from  the  standpoint  of analyzing actual complete lab testing results longitudinally for large COVID-19 patient cohorts. Recent studies have identified coagulation associated issues in COVID-19 patients22,23.

6coagulation signals (e.g. by longitudinal lab testing of platelet count, fibrinogen levels, d-dimer values) and the levels of immune cells (e.g. neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, lymphocytes) inCOVID-19 patients that are long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedders versus patients who are able to more rapidly eliminate the viral RNA. Follow up studies need to examine how the duration of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive status correlates to the rate of IgG seroconversion and the presence of effective humoral immunity as measured by neutralizing antibodies. MethodsSARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests conducted by Mayo Clinic hospitals and health systemPatients  seen  at  Mayo  Clinic  in  Rochester  MN  were  tested  by  either  a  laboratory-developed test or the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay25,26. The Roche cobas test was employed by the Mayo Clinic’s Florida hospitals, and the Abbott diagnostic test was used by the Mayo Clinic’s Arizona hospitals27. These SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests amplify different segments of the viral genomebut  are  considered  largely  equivalent  from  the  perspective  of  their  analytical performance. The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)code of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG test analyzed is 94563-4(https://loinc.org/94563-4/)28.Statistical analysis of longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR resultsThe features considered in the analysis to differentiate the COVID-19 patients that are persistently PCR positive include all structured entities from the EHR, including but not limited to demographics, diagnosis, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)codes, medication history, immunization record, procedures, vitals and lab tests. Any feature which is enriched significantly towards either shorter durations (less than 14 days between  first  positive  tosecond  negative  test,  as  depicted  in Figure  2b)  or  longer  durations (greater than or equal to 28 days between first positive to recent/final positive test, as depicted in Figure 2c) was noted down. During the observation period (n = 201; 99 persistently PCR positive patients;  102  control  patients),  there  were  289  EHR-derived  features  that  were  considered, including potentially prior to each patient’s COVID-19 diagnosis. The 2-proportion z-test p-value (after Benjamini-Hochberg [BH]adjustment for multiple hypothesis correction) was used to assess the differences of each feature between the persistently PCR positive patients and the control cohort, defined as those COVID-19 patients with an upper bound of infection duration between 1 to 13 days. The procedure was as follows:1.Filter by features which are present in overall at least 10% of the patients we’re looking at.2.It’s possible that there is a bias of more overall features towards the long-term or control cohort. We are not interested in this bias. To account for this, for each feature, we compute the  “baseline”  proportion  difference,  i.e.  the  weighted  mean  proportion  of  persistently positive patients that are positive for that feature minus the weighted mean proportion of control cohort which is positive for that feature. Call this baseline difference O(we have one such Ofor each feature).3.Perform a 2-proportion z-test for whether the difference between feature-positive rate in the long-term cohort and feature-positive rate in the control cohort is significantly different from the baseline O. .

74.Adjust these p-values for multiple hypotheses using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (with False Discovery Rate [FDR]controlled at 0.1 level).We  repeated  the  above  procedure  for  slightly  different  underlying  data  as  well;  in particular, we re-ran on the following variants:i.We filtered to look only at patients who were not hospitalized (as those would be of most concern).ii.Each binary feature (phenotype, lab test, etc) occurred at a particular day in the patient’s record. We filtered by only those features which occur 0, 21 or 28 days following diagnosis.iii.Variations (i) and (ii) togetherPrediction of Positive Culture Probability by RT-PCR Crossing point (Cp) ValueEstimated probability of positive culture (‘y’) by RT-PCR cycle threshold Crossing point (Cp)values (‘x’) was calculated using the following formula.This formula was derived by fitting a quadratic equation to RT-PCR Cp Values and positive culture rates, as reported by La Scola, B. et al7.","A recent study from China of 74 COVIDpospatient’s fecal samples and respiratory swabs observed SARS-CoV-2-positive swabs with a mean duration of 15.4 days and standard deviation of 6.7 days from the first symptom onset15. In this study, we have shown that COVID-19 patients that are long-term shedders are predominantly not hospitalized, thus underlining the importance  .

4of understanding the temporal dynamics of viral load, the duration of infectivity, and the likelihood of community transmission. Studies focusing on the temporal profiles of viral shedding suggest that the viral loads are highest at symptom onset, and subsequently decrease over the following 21 day13,16and that live virus could no longer be cultured after day 8, leading to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness may decline from the time of symptom onset12,13. Whether such experimental results are generalizable to allCOVID-19 patients that are long-term shedders is an important follow-up question. Based on a recent study that characterized SARS-CoV-2 viral replication as a function of RT-PCR  Cpvalues,attempting  a  characterization  of488  PCR  tests  from  208  SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in our study,7would suggestpercentage of positive cultures of mean 49.2% andstandard deviation 23.7% (Figure  4 -Supplementary  Figure  1a). Likewise, extrapolating the corresponding distribution of percentage of positive culture values in the 63 patients with viral RNA shedding beyond 21 days based on the last positive PCR tests would have mean of 33.3% and  standard  deviation  of  7.6%  (Figure  4 -Supplementary  Figure  1b),  while  these  figures beyond the 28 days threshold would have mean of 33.6% and standard deviation of 8.2% (Figure 4 -Supplementary  Figure  1c). Given it  is  impossible  to  effectively  apply  the  relationship garnered  between  Cp  values  and  positive  cultures  from  different published RT-PCR  assaystowards thisstudy, positive culture characterization for our RT-PCR assay would involve a follow-up investigation that incorporates longitudinal viral load assessments. Although  the  SARS-CoV-2-positive  RT-PCR  tests  by  no  means  causally  implicate replication-competent virus, the presence of viral RNA for several weeks from initial infection certainly  warrants  longitudinal  monitoring  of  the  viral  load5,7.  Nonetheless,  the  question  still remains as to why some COVIDpospatients harbor virus or viral RNA for far longer than other COVIDpospatients. Our observations regarding non-hospitalized, IgG-seropositive, long-term viral RNA shedders highlights the need for follow-up studies to study the neutralizing potential for antibodies  generated  by  long-term  shedders  and  contextualize  such  analysis  vis-a-vis  direct assessment of viral loads and more quantitative assays such as ddPCR.5,6The assessment of whether any of the IgG and IgM antibodies generated are able to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins (spike, envelope, membrane) or the nucleocapsid protein14would add an immunological lens to interpret the seroconversion upper bounds noted in this  study.  Taken  together,  such  additional  research  would  help  inform  whether  current  CDC guidelines of 10 days self-quarantining for asymptomatic patients may be broadly satisfactory, including for patients that are noted to be long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedders8.Several  factors  could  influence  the  persistent  SARS-CoV-2  PCR  positive status. Replicative fitness of a given virus is one of them. For instance, in HIV, not all viruses replicate equivalently, and differences may be attributable in part to polymorphisms in different genes18. For  SARS-CoV-2,  there  are  reports  of  different  polymorphisms  that  have  been  speculated  to impact disease severity or transmissibility, such as the D164G mutation in the spike (S) protein19. Another  factor  that  may  influence  the  persistence  of  PCR  positivity  could  be  the  timing  and robustness of the immune response. For example, given the role of the IFN response in viral shedding20, early IFN response is likely to be beneficial and reduce shedding, whereas late IFN  .

5response may be deleterious and delay clearance. Another potential factor to consider is the T cell  response21.  When  T cells  express  high  levels  of  different  effector  mechanisms  (e.g. Perforin/granzyme B, IFN), they are thought to work better than if they produce only one effector pathway.It may be noted that the clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests has been debated to some extent17, and certainly there are anecdotal examples from our own clinic experience where critical ill COVID-19 patients can switch from a COVIDposstatus to a COVIDnegstatus within a short period of time. To robustly enable scientific assessment of the sensitivity of the routine RT-PCR testing data analyzed here, we summarized the entire pattern of serial PCR outcomes across the 5,569 COVID-19 patients in this study. This analysis shows that the vast majority of the  COVID-19  patients  subjected  to  our  RT-PCR  assays  do  produce  consistent  results,  as determined by multiple contiguous PCR tests resulting in the same outcome. There is a small minority of COVID-19 patients where aberrant switching of PCR results is indeed observed, with the underlying reasons undetermined at this juncture. In order to understand whether long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedders display any other distinctive features from the structured EHR, we defined a control cohort ofCOVID-19 patients with an upper bound of infection duration between 1 to 13 days (“short-term shedders”). We compared the long-term shedders with this control cohort by analyzing the counts of over 15,000 features  constituting  the  fields  of  structured  EHRdatabases,  including  diagnosis,  ICD  codes, medication history, immunization records, procedures, and demographics (see Methods). We do not find any significant distinguishing clinical features for long-term shedders compared to short-term  shedders  across multiple  scenarios:  (1)  all  patients,  features  from  last  90  days  ,  (2)  all patients, features from after diagnosis, (3) all patients, features from 21 days after diagnosis, (4) all patients, features from 28 days after diagnosis, (5) non-hospitalized patients, features from last 90 days, (6) non-hospitalized patients, features from 21 days after diagnosis, (7) non-hospitalized patients, features from 28 days after diagnosis, and (8) non-hospitalized patients, features from diagnosis date.While this preliminary observation from structured EHR counts has to be monitored as more COVID-19 patients’ longitudinal lab results are available, at this juncture, it appears that the majority  of  long-term  shedders  are  non-hospitalized  patients  with  likely  mild  or  moderate symptoms that do not prompt their detailed clinical follow-up.

Healthcare disparities among anticoagulation therapies for severe COVID-19 patients in the multi-site VIRUS registry,"COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk of thrombosis and various anticoagulants are  being  used  in  patient  management  without  an  established  standard-of-care.  Here,  we analyze hospitalized and ICU patient outcomes from the Viral Infection and Respiratory illness Universal  Study  (VIRUS)registry.  We  find  that  severe  COVID  patients  administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have a higher mortality-rate (311 deceased patients out  of  760  total  patients  =  41%)  compared  to  patients  administered  enoxaparin  but  not unfractionated heparin (214 deceased patients out of 1,432 total patients = 15%), presenting a risk ratio of 2.74 (95% C.I.: [2.35, 3.18]; p-value: 1.4e-41). This difference persists even after balancing  on  a  number  of  covariates  including:  demographics,  comorbidities,  admission diagnoses, and method of oxygenation, with an amplified mortality rate of 39% (215 of 555) for unfractionated heparin vs. 23% (119 of 522) for enoxaparin, presenting a risk ratio of 1.70 (95% C.I.:  [1.40,  2.05];  p-value:  2.5e-7).  In  these  balanced  cohorts,  a  number  of  complications occurred  at  an  elevated  rate  for  patients  administered  unfractionated  heparin  compared  to those administered enoxaparin, including acute kidney injury (227 of 642 [35%] vs. 156 of 608 [26%] respectively, adjusted p-value 0.0019), acute cardiac injury (40 of 642 [6.2%] vs. 15 of 608 [2.5%] respectively, adjusted p-value 0.01), septic shock (118 of 642 [18%] vs. 73 of 608 [12%] respectively,  adjusted  p-value  0.01),  and  anemia  (81  of  642  [13%]  vs.  46  of  608  [7.6%] respectively,  adjusted  p-value  0.02). Furthermore,  a  higher  percentage  of  Black/African American COVID patients (375 of 1,203 [31%]) were noted to receive unfractionated heparin compared to White/Caucasian COVID patients (595 of 2,488 [24%]), for a risk ratio of 1.3 (95% C.I.: [1.17, 1.45], adjusted p-value: 1.6e-5). After balancing upon available clinical covariates, this  difference in  anticoagulantuse  remained  statistically significant  (272  of  959  [28%]  for Black/African  American  vs.  213  of  959  [22%]  for  White/Caucasian,  adjusted  p-value: 0.01, relative  risk:  1.28,  95%  C.I.:  [1.09,  1.49]).While  retrospective  studies  cannot  suggest  any causality,  these  findings  motivate  the  need  for  follow-up  prospective  research  in  order  to elucidate  potential  socioeconomic,  racial,  or  other  disparities  underlying  the  use  of anticoagulants to treat severe COVID patients.  .

2IntroductionMajor  complications  of  severe  COVID-19  include  coagulopathy  and  cardiovascular events1–3.    Through  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  ACTIV  initiative,  there  are  multiple ongoing research studies to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of various types and doses of anticoagulants4.  According to NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., “There is currently no standard of care for anticoagulation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and there is a desperate need  for  clinical  evidence  to  guide  practice.”4Due  to  the  current  knowledge  gap  in  evidence-based anticoagulant treatments for severe COVID-19, there are many open questions on topics including: types of anticoagulant medications to prescribe, dosing for anticoagulants, indications for anticoagulant prescriptions, and prophylactic vs. therapeutic use.  In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  which  types  of  anticoagulant  medications  to  prescribe  for patients  with  severe  COVID-19.    We  conduct  this  analysis  on  the Society  for  Critical  Care Medicine’s VIRUS registry5, a large-scale, international, multi-site study of hospitalized COVID-19  patients. We  consider  three  categories  of  anticoagulant  medications:  (1)  Unfractionated Heparin, (2) Enoxaparin, and (3) Other types of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH).  First, we consider head-to-head comparisons of enoxaparin vs. unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin vs. other types of LMWH by constructing cohorts of hospitalized COVID patients who received one anticoagulant medication but not the other during their hospital stay for COVID-19.  For each cohort comparison, we evaluate patient outcomes including:mortality at hospital discharge, 28-day mortality status, average hospital length of stay in days, average ICU length of stay in days, and complications during the 28-day follow-up period.  In addition, for each comparison we repeat the  analysis  using  propensity  score  matching  to  control  for  potential  confounding  variables including:  demographics,  comorbidities,  evidence  of  infiltrates,  ICU  admission  status,  initial oxygenation  method,  admission  diagnoses,  and  time  in  days  to  anticoagulant  administration. Finally,  we  analyzed  the  rates  of  anticoagulant  medication  administration  by  race,  focusing  on cohorts  of  Black/African  American  and  White/Caucasian  patients.    Similar,  we  used  propensity score  matching  to  construct  race-based  cohorts  balanced  on  the  clinical  covariates  listed previously, and we report patient outcomes for both the original and the propensity-matched race-stratified cohorts.

3As of September 26,2020, the total size of the study population is 28,964 patients reported by  244  hospitals  across  21  countries.  Whilea  portion  of  sites  report  data  for  each  day  in  the hospital  for  each  patient,  emphasis  is  placed  on  capturing  data  at  key  events  in  the  treatment process. These include the day of admission to the hospital, the first three days in the hospital, and first day of admission to the ICU (if admitted) as well as outcomes measures like the duration of stay in the hospital and the ICU (if admitted) and the 28-day survival status. Data completeness of  the  features  is  variable  depending  on  the  frequency  of  updates  from  the  sites.  Data  for  the registry is collected via REDCap and can be automatically filled from a site’s EHR data.Features  reported  include  comorbidities  listed  in  the  VIRUS  questionnaire  (obesity, diabetes,   hypertension,   etc.),   complications   (acute   kidney   injury,   deep   vein   thrombosis, coagulopathy,  etc.),  medications  prescribed  in  hospital  (antibacterials,  anticoagulants,  statins, etc.)  as  well  as  more  refined  medication  features  within  a  category  (Antivirals:  Remdesivir, Ritonavir,  Lopinavir,  etc.).  Other  features  collected  for  each  patient  include  Hospital  Length  of Stay, ICU Length of Stay, Height, Weight, etc. Prior  studies  suggest  that  enoxaparin  may  be  more  efficacious  than  unfractionated heparin  in  the  treatment  of  conditions  like  acute  coronary syndromes6and  these  are  two  most frequently  administered  anticoagulants  (Supplementary  Table  S1).  Thus,  we  compare  the outcomes of patients taking enoxaparin and heparin by constructing two cohorts: (i) patients who were  administered  enoxaparin  but  not  unfractionated  heparin  and  (ii)  patients  who  were administered  unfractionated  heparin  but  not  enoxaparin.  The  cohort  sizes  were  1814  and  887 respectively. Statistical tests were applied to 21 outcomes (with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure applied to account for the problem of multiple comparisons; details below). Mortality at hospital discharge  was  the  primary  outcome  of  interest.  Outcomes  that  were  compared  include  (1) mortality at hospital discharge, (2) mortality at 28 days, (3) admission to ICU (within 28 days of hospitalization),  (4)  length  of  stay  in  ICU  (among  alive  patients),  (5)  length  of  stay  in  hospital (among  alive  patients),  and  the  following  16  complications:  (6)  acute  cardiac  injury,  (7)  acutekidney  injury,  (8)  anemia,  (9)  bacteremia,  (10)  bacterial  pneumonia,  (11)  cardiac  arrest,  (12) cardiac arrhythmia, (13) co-or secondary infection, (14) congestive heart failure, (15) deep vein thrombosis,  (16)  hyperglycemia,  (17)  liver  dysfunction,  (18) pleural  effusions,  (19)  ARDS,  (20) septic shock, (21) stroke/cerebrovascular incident. The diagnostic criteria available are outlined in  Supplementary Table S2.To account for potentially confounding variables, we performed propensity score matching to balance covariates between the two cohorts. The statistical tests for differences in outcomes were   repeated   on   the   matched   cohorts.   The   covariates   which   were   balanced   include demographics, comorbidities and various features on admission. Further detail on the procedure, including a listing of covariates used, is below.  The code to process the raw data files was written in R v3.6.1.  The code to perform the statistical analyses was written in Python v3.7.7, using the scikit-learn  package  v0.23.2  to  train  the logistic  regression  models  for  the  propensity  score matching  step.    In Supplementary Table S3,  we  show  the  data  completeness  for  the  clinical covariates  that  we  used  for  matching.    Most  covariates  have  close  to  full  completeness  (over 90%), with the exception of the “evidence of infiltrates” covariate, which has roughly 80% data completeness.  For this field, missing values were imputed to be the mean of other values of the field within the treatment group.   .

4Statistical MethodsFor each of the cohort comparisons, we ran a series of statistical significance tests in order to  compare  across  each  of  the  patient  outcome  variables  of  interest.    For  categorical  outcome variables (e.g. mortality status, complications), we report the proportion of patients in each cohort that  have  the  outcome  variable,  the  relative  risk  (ratio  of  proportions  for  each  cohort),  95% confidence    interval    for    the    relative    risk,    and    Chi-squared    p-value.    The    function stats.chi2_contingencyfrom the SciPy package in Python was used to compute the Chi-squared p-values. For continuous outcome variables (e.g. hospital/ICU length of stay), we report the mean and standard deviation of the variable in each cohort, along with the p-value from a two-sided  Mann-Whitney  test  (stats.mannwhitneyufrom SciPy)  comparing  the  two  cohorts.  Finally, we apply the Benjamini-Hochberg correction to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons.Propensity score matchingIn  order  to  control  for  potential  confounding  factors  which  may  explain  differences  in patient  outcomes  between  the  Enoxaparin  and  Unfractionated  Heparin  cohorts,  we  used Propensity  Score  Matching  to  balance  the  cohorts7.    First,  propensity  scores  for  each  of  the patients in the two cohorts were computed by fitting a logistic regression model as a function of the  clinical  covariates  (listed  below).    Next,  patients  from  the  Enoxaparin  and  Unfractionated Heparin cohorts were matched using a 1:1 matching ratio and a heuristic caliper of 0.1 x pooled standard  deviation8,  allowing  for  drops.    Prior  to  matching,  there  were  1,814  patients  in  the enoxaparin cohort (administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin), and there were 887 patients  in  the  unfractionated  heparin  cohort  (administered  unfractionated  heparin  but  not enoxaparin).    From  these  two  cohorts,  659  matched  pairs  were  found,  and  statistical  analyses were run on the final matched cohorts.  Here is the full list of covariates that were considered for the propensity score matching step:●Demographics:Age, gender, race, ethnicity.●Comorbidities:Pre-existing conditions, including: (1) asthma, (2) blood loss anemia, (3) cardiac arrhythmias, (4) chronic kidney disease, (5) chronic dialysis, (6) chronic pulmonary disease, (7) coagulopathy, (8) congestive heart failure, (9) coronary artery disease, (10) dementia, (11) depression, (12) diabetes, (13) dyslipidemia/hyperlipidemia, (14) HIV / AIDS or other immunosuppression, (15) hematologic malignancy, (16) Hepatitis B, (17) Hepatitis C, (18) history of solid organ or bone marrow transplant, (19) hypertension, (20) hypothyroidism, (21) iron deficiency anemia, (22) liver disease, (23) malnutrition, (24) metastatic cancer, (25) obstructive sleep apnea / home CPAP / BiPAP use, (26) obesity, (27) paralysis, (28) peptic ulcer disease excluding bleeding, (29) psychosis, (30) pulmonary circulation disorder, (31) rheumatoid arthritis/collagen vascular disease, (32) solid tumor without metastasis, (33) stroke or other neurological disorders, (34) substance use disorder, (35) valvular heart disease, (36) venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis / pulmonary embolism)●In ICU on admission to hospital .

5●Admission diagnoses:Conditions which are present upon admission to hospital for COVID-19, including: (1) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), (2) non-ARDS acute hypoxic respiratory failure, (3) acute liver injury, (4) acute myocardial infarction, (5) acute renal failure/injury (with or without hemofiltration) (6) bacteremia, (7) bacterial pneumonia, (8) cardiac arrest, (9) cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, heart block, torsades des point, ventricular tachycardia), (10) congestive heart failure / cardiomyopathy,(11) delirium / encephalopathy, (12) disseminated intravascular coagulation, (13) gastrointestinal hemorrhage, (14) hyperglycemia, (15) hypoglycemia, (16) meningitis / encephalitis, (17) myocarditis, (18) pleural effusion, (19) pneumothorax, (20) rhabdomyolysis / myositis, (21) seizure, (22) sepsis, (23) shock, (24) stroke.●Evidence of infiltrates via X-ray or CT scan●Oxygenation-related features on admission:Supplemental oxygenation method on day of admission, among: (1) invasive mechanical ventilation, (2) noninvasive ventilation (CPAP or BIPAP), (3) high flow nasal cannula, (4) bag mask oxygen therapy, (5) non-rebreather mask oxygen therapy, (6) nasal cannula, (7) miscellaneous other form of oxygenation.●Day of anticoagulant administration: First day that the patient received the anticoagulant of interest (unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, or other LMWH), relative to the day of hospital admission for COVID-19. The same propensity score matching procedure was done with enoxaparin vs. other lowmolecular weight heparin in place of enoxaparin vs. unfractionated heparin. Propensity score matching was also applied to balance covariates between the Black/African American and White/Caucasian patient cohorts; the “outcome” compared in this case was therate of administration of each anticoagulant. All of the same covariates (except race and day of anticoagulant administration) listed above were used in this balancing.ResultsIn Figure 1, we present the mortality rate and ICU admission rate for patients in the SCCM VIRUS registry5with outcomes data available.  Among the 28,964 patients in the VIRUS registry at the time of the study, hospital discharge status was available for 8,623 patients, of which 6,208 (72%)  were  alive  at  discharge.  For  patients  that  were  administered  enoxaparin  but  not unfractionated heparin, hospital discharge status was available for 1,432 patients, of which 1,217 (85%) were alive at discharge. For patients that were administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin, hospital discharge status was available for 760 patients, and 448 (59%) were alive at discharge. Comparing the mortality outcomes (unadjusted), patients in the heparin cohort have a  higher  mortality  rate  compared  to  those  in  the  enoxaparin  cohort  (risk  ratio:  2.74;  95%  C.I.: [2.35, 3.18]; p-value: 1.4e-41)(Figure 1a). For patients that were administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin, ICU admission status was available for 1,690 patients, of which794 (47%)  were  admitted  to  the  ICU.  Similarly,  for  patients  that  were  administered  unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin, ICU admission status was available for 863 patients, of which 570 (66%)  were  admitted  to  the  ICU.  Comparing  the  ICU  admission  status  (unadjusted),  patients administered  unfractionated  heparin  had  a  higher  rate  of  admission  to  the  ICU  compared  to  .

6patients administered enoxaparin (risk ratio: 1.41; 95% C.I.: [1.32, 1.51]; p-value: 3.4e-20) (Figure 1b). Next, we compared the average lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital for the two cohorts. Here, we restricted the analysis to only patients that were alive at discharge. The length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital were shorter for the enoxaparin patients (mean ICU duration: 10.9 days, mean hospital duration: 11.9 days) compared to the unfractionated heparin patients (mean ICU duration: 13.9 days, mean hospital duration: 16.7 days) (Figure 1c-d). While the difference in average hospital length of stay is statistically significant (Mann-Whitney p-value: 5.2e-5), the difference  in  average  ICU  length  of  stay  is  not  statistically  significant  (Mann-Whitney  p-value: 0.16). In Figure 2, we present the mortality rate and ICU admission rate for patients with different comorbidities: diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure.  We observe  that  for  the  subgroups  of  patients  with  diabetes,  hypertension,  and  congestive  heart failure,  patients  administered  enoxaparin  have  significantly  lower  rates  of  ICU  admission  and death compared to patients administered unfractionated heparin.  For patients with chronic kidney disease,  the  difference  in  ICU  admission  rates  between  the  enoxaparin  and  unfractionated heparin cohorts is statistically significant (risk ratio: 1.32,95% C.I.: [1.06, 1.64], p-value: 0.01), however, the difference in mortality status is not statistically significant (risk ratio: 1.31, 95% C.I.: [0.94, 1.82], p-value: 0.12).  Next,  we  perform  propensity  score  matching  to  control  for  a  wide  array  of  confounding factors  simultaneously.    The  clinical  characteristics  of  the  matched  and  original  unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin cohorts are shown in Table 1. Most covariates (including demographics, comorbidities,  and  admission  diagnoses)  appear  well-matched.  Of  the  659  patients  in  the matched  enoxaparin  cohort,  mortality  status  at  discharge  was  available  for  522,  of  which  119 (23%) were deceased on discharge; in the matched heparin cohort, information was available for 555  patients  of  which  215  (39%)  weredeceased  on  discharge  (Table  2).  This  difference  in mortality rates upon discharge was statistically significant (risk ratio: 1.70, 95% CI: [1.40, 2.05], adjusted p-value: 2.5e-7). The mortality rates reported at 28-days for both cohorts were consistent with the mortality rates reported upon hospital discharge, and differences in rates between the two  cohorts  were  similarly  statistically  significant.    Differences  between  the  two  cohorts  in  the average hospital and ICU length of stays were not statisticallysignificant after matching.Information on complications that occurred after hospitalization was available for 608 of 659 patients in the matched enoxaparin cohort, and for 642 of 659 patients in the matched heparin cohort. Complications that occurred ata significantly higher rate in the matched heparin cohort compared to the matched enoxaparin cohort include: acute kidney injury (227 of 642 [35%] vs. 156 of 608 [26%] respectively, adjusted p-value 0.0019), acute cardiac injury (40 of 642 [6.2%] vs. 15 of 608 [2.5%] respectively, adjusted p-value 0.01), septic shock (118 of 642 [18%] vs. 73 of  608  [12%]  respectively,  adjusted  p-value  0.01),  and  anemia  (81  of  642  [13%]  vs.  46  of  608 [7.6%,] respectively, adjusted p-value 0.02) (Table 2). We also conducted an equivalent analysis comparing Enoxaparin vs other types of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). The matching table is shown in Table 3. Of the 717 patients  .

7in this matched enoxaparin cohort, mortality status at discharge was available for 569 patients, of which 122 (21%) were deceased on discharge. In the 717 patients in the matched other LMWH cohort,  information  was  available  for  648  patients,  of  which  217  (33%)  were  deceased  on discharge   (risk   ratio:   1.56,   95%   C.I.:   [1.29,   1.89];   adjusted   p-value   4.4e-5)   (Table  4). Complications which show statistically significant differences between the cohorts are ARDS (178 of 666 [27%] for enoxaparin vs. 236 of 697 [34%] for low molecular weight heparin; adjusted p-value: 0.03) and viral pneumonitis (125 of 66 [19%] for enoxaparin vs. 51 of 697 [7.3%] for low molecular weight heparin, adjusted p-value: 1.1e-8).We also examined whether there were any race-based differences in the administration of enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin. The cohorts of interest were Black/African American patients with anticoagulant information available (n = 1,203) and White/Caucasian patients with anticoagulant information available (n = 2,488).  Propensity score matching was performed, and the clinical characteristics of the matched and original cohorts are shown in Table 5. We observe that the clinical covariates are well-balanced for the matched cohorts.  Rates of administration of unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, and other LMWH medications for the original and matched cohorts are shown in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.Looking   at   the   original   unmatched   cohorts,   Black/African   American   patients   had significantly    higher    rates    of    administration    of    unfractionated    heparin    compared    to White/Caucasian  patients  (375  of  1203  [31%]  vs.595  of  2488  [24%]  respectively,  adjusted  p-value: 1.6e-05) (Table 6). After matching, this difference in unfractionated heparin use remains statistically significant (272 of 959 [28%] for Black/African American patients vs. 213 of 959 [22%] for White/Caucasian patients, adjusted p-value: 0.01) (Table 7).  On the other hand, enoxaparin and other low molecular weight heparins are administered at similar rates in the unmatched and matched  cohorts  (Tables 6-7).  Finally, the proportion of patients which took exclusively  either enoxaparin   or   unfractionated   heparin   are   similar   for   the   Black/African   American   and White/Caucasian cohorts.  DiscussionPrior work has shown that anticoagulant treatments and prophylaxis are associated with improved outcomes for COVID-19 patients9,10,.  In particular, there is evidence to suggest that low molecular weight heparin can be used to effectively treat COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy11.  This retrospective analysis suggests that enoxaparin, a particular form of low molecular weight heparin,  shows  promise  as  an  anticoagulant  therapy  for  severe  COVID-19,  compared  to  both unfractionated  heparin  and  other  low  molecular  weight  heparin  therapies.    These  findings  are consistent with a retrospective study on electronic health records from the Mayo Clinic which has found  that  enoxaparin  is  associated  withlower  rates  of  thrombotic  events,  kidney  injury,  and mortality  in  comparison  with  unfractionated  heparin12.    However,  this  study  goes  beyond  the previous analysis by leveraging the massive SCCM VIRUS data registry of hospitalized COVID-19  patients  from  multiple  sites  around  the  world.    As  a  result,  we  find  that  there  are  additional complications which are enriched at a statistically significant level in the unfractionated heparin cohort compared to theenoxaparin cohort, including septic shock and anemia.   .

8There  are  several  limitations  of  this  study.  While  we  have  longitudinal  data  from  the registry  on  daily  anticoagulant  use,  we  do  not  have  access  to  the  detailed  physician  notes  for these  patients. Therefore,  in  this  dataset  we  cannot  distinguish  between  prophylactic  and therapeutic  anticoagulant  use.    Since  we  include  only  patients  who  received  an  anticoagulant medication,  there  is  potential  for  immortal  time  bias  because  there  may  be  some  patientswho died prior to anticoagulant administration in the hospital.  Another limitation of this study is the lack of follow-up data for all patients.  For many sites, we do not have access to follow-up data for patients to determine 28-day mortality status, so the mortality rates may be skewed towards the sites of the study where this outcome data is most available.  Finally, there are differences in the  FDA  drug  labels  for  unfractionated  heparin,  enoxaparin,  and  other  forms  of  low  molecular weight  heparin,  which  can  lead  to  differences  in  real-world  patterns  of  prescription13,14.  For example, patients with active kidney disease are contraindicated for higher doses of enoxaparin.  However, unfractionated heparin does not require any dose modifications for patients with active kidney disease, so there may be a preference for this medication among this cohort of patients.  Although these biases in prescription patterns are partially controlled for by the propensity score matching algorithm, there may be some additional unobserved confounding factors which are not taken into consideration.  There are numerous follow-up analyses which may be inspired from this study. As more data becomes available, we may investigate differential patient outcomes for other variants of low molecular weight heparin beyond enoxaparin.  Similar comparative analyses may be undertaken for other COVID-19 treatment options beyond anticoagulants, such as supplemental oxygenation methods.    This  study  demonstrates  the  utility  of  the  SCCM  VIRUS  data  registry  for  analyzing diverse  research  questions  related  to  therapeutics  for  severe  COVID-19  patients5.    Finally,  a number  of  studieshave  been  analyzing  the  association  between  race/ethnicity  and  clinical outcomes in COVID-1915,16. From this study, the race-associated differences in the administration of the anticoagulants enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin warrants further analyses into the associations between patients’ race/ethnicity, comorbidities, and administration of medications in managing COVID-19.","Prior work has shown that anticoagulant treatments and prophylaxis are associated with improved outcomes for COVID-19 patients9,10,.

Here,  we analyze hospitalized and ICU patient outcomes from the Viral Infection and Respiratory illness Universal  Study  (VIRUS)registry.  We  find  that  severe  COVID  patients  administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have a higher mortality-rate (311 deceased patients out  of  760  total  patients  =  41%)  compared  to  patients  administered  enoxaparin  but  not unfractionated heparin (214 deceased patients out of 1,432 total patients = 15%), presenting a risk ratio of 2.74 (95% C.I.: [2.35, 3.18]; p-value: 1.4e-41). This difference persists even after balancing  on  a  number  of  covariates  including:  demographics,  comorbidities,  admission diagnoses, and method of oxygenation, with an amplified mortality rate of 39% (215 of 555) for unfractionated heparin vs. 23% (119 of 522) for enoxaparin, presenting a risk ratio of 1.70 (95% C.I.:  [1.40,  2.05];  p-value:  2.5e-7).  In  these  balanced  cohorts,  a  number  of  complications occurred  at  an  elevated  rate  for  patients  administered  unfractionated  heparin  compared  to those administered enoxaparin, including acute kidney injury (227 of 642 [35%] vs. 156 of 608 [26%] respectively, adjusted p-value 0.0019), acute cardiac injury (40 of 642 [6.2%] vs. 15 of 608 [2.5%] respectively, adjusted p-value 0.01), septic shock (118 of 642 [18%] vs. 73 of 608 [12%] respectively,  adjusted  p-value  0.01),  and  anemia  (81  of  642  [13%]  vs.  46  of  608  [7.6%] respectively,  adjusted  p-value  0.02). Furthermore,  a  higher  percentage  of  Black/African American COVID patients (375 of 1,203 [31%]) were noted to receive unfractionated heparin compared to White/Caucasian COVID patients (595 of 2,488 [24%]), for a risk ratio of 1.3 (95% C.I.: [1.17, 1.45], adjusted p-value: 1.6e-5). After balancing upon available clinical covariates, this  difference in  anticoagulantuse  remained  statistically significant  (272  of  959  [28%]  for Black/African  American  vs.  213  of  959  [22%]  for  White/Caucasian,  adjusted  p-value: 0.01, relative  risk:  1.28,  95%  C.I.:  [1.09,  1.49]).While  retrospective  studies  cannot  suggest  any causality,  these  findings  motivate  the  need  for  follow-up  prospective  research  in  order  to elucidate  potential  socioeconomic,  racial,  or  other  disparities  underlying  the  use  of anticoagulants to treat severe COVID patients.

"Enoxaparin is associated with lower rates of thrombosis, kidney injury, and mortality than Unfractionated Heparin in hospitalized COVID patients","Although anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, e.g. enoxaparin) are both being used for therapeutic mitigation of COVID associated coagulopathy (CAC), differences in their clinical outcomes remain to be investigated. Here, we employ automated neural networks supplemented with expert curation (‘augmented curation’) for retrospectively  analyzing  the  complete  electronic  health  records  (EHRs)  of  671  hospitalized COVID-19 patients administered either enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin, but not both. We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have higher rates of mortality (risk ratio: 2.6; 95% C.I.: [1.2-5.4]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjustedp-value: 0.09), thrombotic events (risk ratio: 5.7, 95%    C.I.: [2.1, 33.9], p-value: 0.024), acute kidney injury (risk ratio: 5.5; 95% C.I.: [1.2-17.7]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.10), and bacterial pneumonia (risk ratio undefined; 95% C.I.: [1.0, 292]; p-value:0.02; BH adjusted p-value:0.10), compared to patients administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin. Notably, even after controlling for  potential  confounding  factors  such  as  demographics,  comorbidities,  admission  diagnosis, initial  ICU  status,  and  initial  level  of  oxygen  support,  the  above  differences  between  the enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin patient cohorts remain statistically significant. This study emphasizes  the  need  for  mechanistically  investigating  differential  modulation  of  the  COVID-associated coagulation cascades by enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin. IntroductionCOVID-19 manifests in varying levels of patient outcomes ranging from mild, moderate to severe  disease1–3.  While  the  mild/asymptomatic  patients  have  been  managed  through quarantining  and  self-medication,  the  optimal  management  of  hospitalized  moderately  ill  or severely  ill  COVID-19  patients  remains  a  formidable  challenge.  Owingto  the  diversity  of comorbidities  and  complications  in  the  afflicted  patients  and  the  overwhelming  pace  of  the pandemic  the  regimen  of  medications  in  COVID-19  critical  care  is  yet  to  be  standardized. Meanwhile, the accumulation of real-world data on patient outcomes of COVID-19 from various healthcare systems provides an excellent opportunity to identify underlying trends that could lead to actionable insights.  .

2Coagulopathies  are  a  major  class  among  COVID-19  associated  complications4, particularly in a critical care setting5. Prior studies have provided a fine grained resolution of the hematological parameters in COVID-19 patients6. Trials comparing anticoagulation treatments are ongoing, however owing to the wide-spread and severe impact of the disease, there is a need for evaluation of observational data in order to rapidly generate evidence to guide treatment7. A spectrum of anticoagulants such as Heparin, Enoxaparin, and Rivaroxaban are being used in COVID-19 patient management as needed8,9. A clinical trial is being designed to examine whether prophylactic-dose enoxaparin improves survival and reduces hospitalizations in older (age > 50) symptomatic  ambulatory  patients10.    Furthermore,  recent  in  vitro  studies  have  shown  that pseudotyped  viral  particles  were  efficiently  neutralized  by  a  variety  of  anticoagulants 11.  In addition,  results  from  a  phase  II  clinical  trial  found  that  patients  treated  with  therapeutic enoxaparin  had  improved  gas  exchange  and  more  ventilator-free  days  compared  to  patients treated  with  standard  anticoagulant  thromboprophylaxis12.    However,  the  full  array  of  patient outcomes associated with various anticoagulants remains to be understood. The availability of patient outcomes and drugs administered in Mayo Clinic sites and associated health systems enables us to address this question. Here, we present a comparison of the patient outcomes in terms of mortality status, ICU admission and the durations of stay in ICU and hospital in severe COVID-19 patients that were administered Heparin vs. Enoxaparin. We use propensity score matching to construct matched cohorts for comparison which are balanced across a range of clinicalcovariates,  including:  demographics,  comorbidities,  admission  diagnosis,  initial  ICU status, and initial level of oxygen support (see Methods). The clinical covariates for the study populations of the original and matched cohorts are presented in Table 1.The outcomes for the original and matched cohorts are presented in Table 2and Table 3, respectively.  ResultsPatients  that  were  administered  enoxaparin  have  lower  mortality  rates,  lower  ICU admission rates, and shorter hospital / ICU staysWe compared the mortality rate and ICU admission rate in patients from the curated Mayo Clinic dataset of 671 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received either enoxaparin or heparin, but not both. Of these patients, 464 were administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin; of these 14 (3%) were deceased. For comparison, 207 patients were administered heparin but not enoxaparin. Of these patients, 32 (15%) were deceased. Comparing the mortality outcomes, patients  in  the  heparin  only  cohort  have  a  higher  mortality  rate  than  those  in  the  opposing enoxaparin cohort (risk ratio of death: 5.12; 95% C.I.: [2.76, 9.10]; adjusted p-value 1.7e-8)(Table 2). Of the 464 patients administered enoxaparin but not heparin, 90 (19%) were later admitted to the ICU. Similarly,of the 207 patients administered heparin but not enoxaparin, 70 (34%) were admitted to the ICU. Comparing the ICU admission status, patients administered heparin had a higher admission to ICU rate compared to Enoxaparin (risk ratio of ICU admission: 1.74;95% C.I.: [1.34, 2.27]; adjusted p-value 9.8e-5) (Table 2). Next we compared the lengths of stay in the ICU and the overall length of stay in the hospital. Here, we restricted the analysis to only patients that were alive. The length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital were shorter for patients administered enoxaparin but not heparin (mean  .

3ICU duration: 0.9 days, mean hospital duration: 5.4 days) compared to the patients administered heparin but not enoxaparin (mean ICU duration: 2.8 days, mean hospital duration: 8.1 days) (Table 2). The difference in hospital length of stay and ICU length of stay across the two cohorts are both statistically significant according to a t-test (hospital duration adjusted p-value: 1.5e-8; ICU  duration  adjusted  p-value:  1.5e-8).  Taken  together,  this  suggests  preliminarily  that enoxaparin is correlated with a lower mortality rate, ICU admission rate and ICU and hospital length of stay compared to heparin. Also of note are the increased rates of acute kidney injury (risk ratio: 5.2; 95% C.I.: [2.68-9.71]; adjusted p-value 7.8e-7), bacterial pneumonia (risk ratio: 5.37; 95% C.I.: [1.89-13.67]; adjusted p-value 2.6e-3) and co-/secondary infection (risk ratio: 5.97; 95% C.I.: [2.32-13.86]; adjusted p-value 1.9e-4) in the heparin cohort (Table4). On examination of cause of death for deceased patients for both cohorts, it is clear that the majority of deaths occurring  in  both  the  heparin  and  enoxaparin  cohorts  are  driven  primarily  by  COVID-19 associated causes giving an indication that divergent rates of mortality between the cohorts is not the result of extraneous illness or accidents (Table 5). After  controlling  for  potential  confounding  variables,  patients  that  were  administered enoxaparin have lower mortality ratesTo simultaneously account for the effects of a range of possible confounders, we also examined statistical differences in outcomes between 1:1 propensity matched cohorts of patients who received enoxaparin but not heparin vs patients who received heparin but not enoxaparin. These  cohorts  were  originally  464  and  207  patients,  respectively;  after  1:1  propensity  score matching we were left with 2 cohorts of size 143; we refer to these cohorts as the “matched enoxaparin” and “matched heparin” cohorts respectively. Qualityof balance between covariates is shown in Table 1. Most covariates (including demographics, comorbidities, and conditions on admission) are well-matched.Of the 158 patients in the matched enoxaparin cohort, 8 (5.6%) were eventually deceased; in the matched heparin cohort, 21 (15%) were deceased (Table 3). The rate of mortality in the matched heparin cohort was higher (chi-square p-value 0.02; adjusted p-value 0.09) (Table 3). The risk ratio of mortality for heparin patients is 2.63 (95% CI: [1.18, 5.41]). Mean hospital length of  stay  (among  alive  patients)  for  matched  heparin  was  6.9  days  vs  5.8  days  for  matched enoxaparin. Mean ICU length of stay (among alive patients) for matched heparin was 1.9 days vs 1.1 days for matched enoxaparin patients. However, neither difference was significant (hospital duration adjusted p-value: 0.17; ICU duration adjusted p-value 0.17).Difference in rates of certain complications among the matched cohorts were analyzed. Complications that occurred at a higher rate in the matched heparin cohort than the matched enoxaparin cohort include acute kidney injury (7.7% vs 1.4%, chi-square p-value 0.2, BH-adjusted p-value 0.10) and bacterial pneumonia (5.6% vs 0%, chi-square p-value 0.01, BH-adjusted p-value 0.10) (Table 6). However, we note that due to small cohort sizes none of these differences were statistically significant after taking into account the adjustment for multiple hypotheses.

4enoxaparin have lower rates of thrombotic eventsWe aimed to see if there were differences in occurrence of thrombotic events amongst patients treated strictly with Heparin and those treated strictly with Enoxaparin. To do so, we used a BERT-based neural network to extract thrombotic events from EHR notes and classify the sentences  sentiment.  If  the  note  was  dated  within  the  timeframe  of  up  to  28-days  after  that patient’s first hospitalization date and contained positive sentiment for a thrombotic event (with >= 0.9 confidence), a patient was considered to have experienced that thrombotic event. Similarly, we identified patients that have thrombotic comorbidities. Patients were considered as having a thrombotic comorbidity if they experienced a thrombotic event up to a year prior to their first hospitalization  date.  Thrombotic  events  considered  were  deep  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, thrombotic stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.We  found  that,  across  all  thrombotic  phenotypes,  there  is  a  greater  or  equal  rate  of complications  during  the  study  period  (days  0  to  28)  for  the  Heparin  cohort  relative  to  the Enoxaparin cohort (risk ratio: 5.7, 95%    C.I.: [2.1, 33.9], p-value: 0.024). In particular, for deep vein thrombosis, the rate is 0.2% in the enoxaparin cohort versus 2.9% in the heparin cohort (risk ratio: 13.5, 95% C.I.:[1.7, 56.8], p-value: 0.01, adjusted p-value: 0.04) (Table 7).  Note that in the year leading up to the study period, there is not a statistically significant difference between these two cohorts (risk ratio: 1.5, 95% C.I.:[0.47, 5.1], p-value: 0.77, adjusted p-value: 1.0) (Table 8).  DiscussionThis retrospective study highlights interesting differences in theoutcomes associated with anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients, warranting further follow up. A few caveats are in order. Compounding this limitation, enoxaparin and heparin differ in FDA label indications. The label for enoxaparin13includes  the  prophylaxis  and  treatment  of  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  with  or without pulmonary embolism (PE) in various settings, the prophylaxis of ischemic complications of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI), and the treatment of acute ST-segment  elevation  MI  managed  medically  or  with  subsequent  percutaneous  coronary intervention. The label for heparin14includes includes similar prophylactic indications as well as the  treatment  of  a  broader  spectrum  of  acute  embolic  events  including  peripheral  arterial embolism  and  embolism  in  the  setting  of  atrial  fibrillation,  the  treatment  of  consumptive coagulopathies,  and  usage  as  an  anticoagulant  in  high-risk  patient  groups  such  as  those undergoing blood transfusions, extracorporeal circulation, and dialysis procedures. Furthermore, it is important to analyze whether these medications were administered as prophylactics or in treatment for a complication. Thus, it is possible that the patient population receiving heparin is more severely or acutely ill to begin with.  In follow-up analyses, it may be interesting to consider initial laboratory values such as eGFR as a measure of baseline liver function as well.  Nevertheless, accumulating evidence suggests that enoxaparin may be more efficacious than heparin in certain cases such as for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes15. Also of interest  as  a  driver  of  differential  outcomes  is  the  phenomenon  of  Heparin  Induced  .

5Thrombocytopenia (HIT), a drug reaction associated with decreased platelet count and a high risk of thrombosis. HIT is caused by platelet-activating antibodies against PF4/heparin complexes and has been shown to occur in some circumstances in COVID-19 patients treated with unfractionated heparin16.These findings highlight the plausibility of a biological underpinning to the observations reported in the present work. Overall, these results motivate future studies and trials that could enable the development of more efficacious standard of practice in regards to administration of anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients. MethodsStudy DesignThis  research  was  conducted  under  IRB  20-003278,  “Study  of  COVID-19  patient characteristics with augmented curation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) to inform strategic and operational decisions”, approved by the Mayo Clinic’s institutional review board (IRB). Under this IRB, an observational study was conducted with a study population of 1108 patients, defined as hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days prior to admission or during admission to the hospital. Data availablefor analysis includes patient demographics (age, gender,  race,  etc.)  as  well  as  clinical  data  (medications  administered,  vital  signs,  ICD-10 diagnoses, etc.). Using this information, a dataset was assembled including key covariates and outcomes measures derived from structured clinical data. Covariates of interest include age, height, weight, comorbidities, admissions diagnoses, oxygenation methods, etc. ICD-10  diagnosis  data  was  consumed  and  used  to  define  three  sets  of  diagnoses  of interest for the patient population. Complications are defined as diagnoses recorded during the patient’s treatment process. Admission diagnoses are defined as diagnoses made on the day of admission  to  the  hospital,  or  within  7  day  prior  to  admission.  Comorbidities  are  definedas diagnoses made from a year prior to admission up to 7 days prior to admission to the hospital. For each of these categories a number of conditions were specified as being of interest and ICD-10 codes were selected to represent each of these conditions.ICD-10 codes used in this analysis are included in the supplement (see Supplementary Material).To compare the outcomes of patients taking different anticoagulants, two cohorts were constructed: (i) patients who were administered enoxaparin but not heparin and (ii) patients who were administered heparin but not enoxaparin. The cohort sizes were 464 and 207 respectively. A number of  statistical tests were conducted to identify any differences in outcomes. Statistical tests  were  applied  to  a  number  of  outcomes  (with  Benjamini-Hochberg  procedure  applied  to account for the problem of multiple comparisons; details below). Initially the following 5 outcomes were analyzed: (1) mortality status (i.e. was the patient ever recorded as deceased), (2) 28-day confirmed mortality status (i.e. of patients for whom we have have some confirmation of mortality status  at  28  days  following  hospitalization,  was  the  patient  among  the  deceased),  (3)  ICU admission during hospitalization, (4) length of stay in the hospital (among alive patients), (5) length of stay in ICU (among alive patients).To further characterize the outcomes of the 2 cohorts, occurrence of each of the following 9 complications from day 0 to day 28 were also analyzed: (1) acute kidney injury, (2) bacterial  .

6pneumonia, (3) cardiac arrest, (4) cardiac arrhythmia, (5) co-or secondary infection, (6) liver dysfunction, (7) pleural effusions, (8) stroke/cerebrovascular incident, and (9) Viral pneumonitis.To account for potentially confounding variables, we performed propensity score matching to balance covariates between the two cohorts. The statistical tests for differences in outcomes were  repeated  on  the  matched  cohorts.  The  covariates  which  were  balanced  include demographics, comorbidities and various features on admission. Further detail on the procedure, including a listing of covariates used, is below.Risk RatioRisk Ratios for Admission to the ICU and Mortality Status were calculated for patient cohorts defined by anticoagulant usage and presence of select comorbidities. Risk Ratio across two  cohorts  of  interest  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  proportion of  cohort  1  which  responds affirmatively to a feature (or all members of a set of features) by the proportion of cohort 2 which responds  affirmatively  to  the  same  feature  (or  set  of  features).  Risk  Ratio  along  with accompanying 95% confidence intervals foreach cohort pair are calculated.Chi-SquareA  Pearson’s  Chi-Square  test  was  run  to  test  for  statistically  significant  differences  in proportion  of  occurrence  of  features  across  cohort  pairs.  This  was  done  using  the stats.chi2_contingency function of the scipy python package. Test statistics and p-values are reported for each cohort pair.t-TestA two-sided t-test was performed to identify statistically significant differences in Hospital Length of Stay and ICU Length of Stay across two cohorts of patients who were discharged from the hospital alive and received different anticoagulants (enoxaparin and heparin). P-values are reported for these tests. Benjamini-Hochberg correctionAs we are comparing multiple outcomes between two anticoagulant cohorts, a Benjamini-Hochberg correction is applied to a set of outcomes. Mortality was identified as a primary outcome prior  to  performing  the  tests,  so  it  may  not  be  necessary  to  apply  the  Benjamini-Hochberg correction on that p-value; however, adjusted p-values are reported for all outcomes.Propensity score matchingThe two cohorts that were balanced were (i) the 464 patients who were administered enoxaparin  but  not  heparin  and  (ii)  the  207  patients  who  were  administered  heparin  but  not enoxaparin. Propensity scores were computed by fitting a logistic regression model to predict which of the 2 cohorts the patient was in, as a function of the covariates (listed further below).  .

7After computing propensity scores, 1:1 matching was done, using a heuristic caliper of 0.1 x pooled std deviation and allowing for drops.17143 matched pairs were found. After checking for quality of cohort balance (see Table 1),the same statistical procedures (chi-square test, t-test, risk ratio). were then run on the two matched cohorts of 143 patients each to identify if differences in outcome persist after the adjustments.The covariates used for balancing are the following. Note all variables below except for age are binary.●Demographics: Age, Gender, Race, Ethnicity●Comorbidities:whether or not the patient has each of the following comorbidities, (1) cancer,  (2)  cardiac  arrhythmias,  (3)  chronic  kidney  disease,  (4)  chronic  pulmonary disease, (5) dementia, (6) depression, (7) diabetes, (8) hypertension, (9) obesity, (10) stroke or other neurological disorders●In ICU on admission to hospital●Diagnosis  on  admission:whether or not the patient is reported to have each of the following  conditions  on  admission  to  hospital.  (1)  acute  kidney  injury,  (2)  bacterial pneumonia, (3) cardiac arrhythmias, (4) delirium / encephalopathy, (5) sepsis, (6) stroke●Oxygenation status on day of admission:whether or not the patient is reported to have received the following forms of oxygen therapy on admissionAugmented  curation  of  thrombotic  event  phenotypes  from  the  unstructured  text  of  the Electronic Health Record (EHR) clinical notesWe used a previously developed state-of-the-art BERT-based neural network to classify sentiment of clinical manifestations and diagnoses in the EHR. Specifically, the model extracts sentences  containing  clinical  phenotypes  and  classifies  their  sentiment  into  the  following categories: Yes (confirmed clinical manifestation or diagnosis), No (ruled out clinical manifestation or  diagnosis),  Maybe  (possibility  of  clinical  manifestation  or  diagnosis),  and  Other  (alternate context,  e.g.  family  history  of  disease).  The  model  was  trained  using  18,490  sentences  and approximately 250 phenotypes with an emphasis on cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic phenotypes. It achieves 93.6% overall accuracy and over 95% precision and recall for both “Yes” and “No” sentiment classification.","This retrospective study highlights interesting differences in theoutcomes associated with anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients, warranting further follow up.

Here, we employ automated neural networks supplemented with expert curation (‘augmented curation’) for retrospectively analyzing the complete electronic health records (EHRs) of 671 hospitalized COVID-19 patients administered either enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin, but not both. We find that COVID-19 patients administered unfractionated heparin but not enoxaparin have higher rates of mortality (risk ratio: 2.6; 95% C.I.: [1.2-5.4]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.09), thrombotic events (risk ratio: 5.7, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 33.9], p-value: 0.024), acute kidney injury (risk ratio: 5.5; 95% C.I.: [1.2-17.7]; p-value: 0.02; BH adjusted p-value: 0.10), and bacterial pneumonia (risk ratio undefined; 95% C.I.: [1.0, 292]; p-value:0.02; BH adjusted p-value:0.10), compared to patients administered enoxaparin but not unfractionated heparin. Notably, even after controlling for potential confounding factors such as demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnosis, initial ICU status, and initial level of oxygen support, the above differences between the enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin patient cohorts remain statistically significant. This study emphasizes the need for mechanistically investigating differential modulation of the COVID-associated coagulation cascades by enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin."
Exploratory analysis of immunization records highlights decreased SARS-CoV-2 rates in individuals with recent non-COVID-19 vaccinations,"Multiple clinical studies are ongoing to assess whether existing vaccines may afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection through trained immunity. In this exploratory study, we analyze immunization records from 137,037individuals who received SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests.    We  find  that  polio,  Hemophilus  influenzae  type-B  (HIB), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella, pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), geriatric flu, and hepatitis A / hepatitis B (HepA-HepB)  vaccines  administered  in  the  past  1,  2,  and  5  years  are  associated  with decreased  SARS-CoV-2  infection  rates,  even  after  adjusting  for  geographic  SARS-CoV-2 incidence and testing rates, demographics, comorbidities, and number of other vaccinations. Furthermore,  age,  race/ethnicity,  and  blood  group  stratified  analyses  reveal  significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 rate among black individuals who have taken the PCV13 vaccine, with relative risk of 0.45 at the 5 year time horizon (n: 653, 95% CI: (0.32, 0.64), p-value: 6.9e-05).  These  findings  suggest  that  additional  pre-clinical  and  clinical  studies  are  warranted  to assess  the  protective  effects  of  existing  non-COVID-19  vaccines  and  explore  underlying immunologic mechanisms.  We note that the findings in this study are preliminary and are subject to change as more data becomes available and as further analysis is conducted.IntroductionSince the genome for SARS-CoV-2 was released on January 11, 2020, scientists around the world  have  been  racing  to  develop  a  vaccine1.  However,  vaccine  development  is  a  long  and expensive process, which takes on average over 10 years under ordinary circumstances2.  Even for the previous epidemics of the past decade, including SARS, Zika, and Ebola, vaccines were not available before the virus spread was largely contained3.  Conventionally vaccinations are intended to train the adaptive immune system by generating an  antigen-specific  immune  response.    However,  studies  are  also  demonstrating  that  certain vaccines  lead  to  protection  against  other  infections  through  trained  immunity4.  For  instance, vaccination  against  smallpox  showed    protection  against  measles  and  whooping  cough5.  Live vaccinia virus was successfully used against smallpox. Due to the urgent need to reduce the spread of COVID-19, scientists are turning to alternate methods to reduce the spread, such as repurposing existing vaccines.  There are some hypotheses that the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) and live poliovirus vaccines may provide some protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection6,7.  There are several ongoing/recruiting clinical trials testing the protective effects of existing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection, including: Polio8, Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine9, Influenza vaccine10, and BCG vaccine11,12,13,14. .

2In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis to determine whether or not a set of existing non-COVID-19 vaccines in the United States are associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In Figure 1, we provide an overview of the study design and statistical analyses.  We consider data from 137,037 individuals from the Mayo Clinic electronic health record (EHR) database who received PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 between February 15, 2020 and July 14, 2020 and have at least one ICD diagnostic code recorded inthe past five years (seeMethods).  In Table 1, we show the clinical characteristics of the study population.  In particular, 92,673 (67%) individuals have at least 1vaccine in the past 5 years relative to the PCR testing date.  In Figure 2, we present the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates for subsets of the study population with particular clinical covariates.  We note that the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection are higher in Black, Asian, and Hispanic racial and ethnic subgroups compared to the overall study population.  This is likely due to higher rates of COVID-19 spread and/or decreased access to PCR testing.  In addition, the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lower in individuals with pre-existing conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, obesity) possibly due to greater caution in avoiding exposure and/or higher PCR testing rates.  Given this study population, we assess the rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals who did and did not receive one of 18 vaccines in the past 1, 2, and 5 years relative to thedate of PCR testing.  In Table 2, we present the full names, common formulations, and counts for the 18 vaccines that we consider.First, we assess the overall association of vaccination status with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection(seeMethods).  We use propensity score matching to construct unvaccinated control groups for each of the vaccinated populations at the 1 year, 2 year, and 5-year time horizons.  The unvaccinated  control  groups  are  balancedin  covariates  including  demographics,  county-level incidence and testing rates for SARS-CoV-2, comorbidities, and number of other vaccines taken in the past 5 years. Then, we compare the SARS-CoV-2 rates between each of the vaccinated cohorts and corresponding matched, unvaccinated control groups which have similar clinical characteristics.  Second, we repeat the analysis on a set of age, race, and blood type stratified subgroups of the study population.  In particular, for each subgroup, we run propensity score matching and compute the difference in SARS-CoV-2infection rate between the vaccinated and unvaccinated (matched) cohorts.  Finally, we run a series of sensitivity analyses to evaluate whether or not these results may be biased from unobserved confounders or other factors.  ResultsPolio, HIB, MMR, Varicella, PCV13, Geriatric Flu, and HepA-HepB vaccines consistently show associations with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection across 1, 2, and 5-year time horizonsThe results of the propensity score matching for the 1 year, 2 year, and 5-year time horizons are presented in Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5, respectively.  We observe that across all time horizons, Polio, Hemophilus Influenzae type B (HIB), Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), Geriatric Flu, Hepatitis A / Hepatitis B (HepA-HepB), and Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccinated cohorts show consistent lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  In Tables  S1-S7, we show the clinical characteristics for the vaccinated, unvaccinated, and matched cohorts for each of these vaccines at  .

3the 1-year time horizon.  In Figure 3, we present the vaccination coverage rates for each of these vaccines in the study population for all time horizons.  Overall, we observe that the Polio and HIB vaccinated cohorts generally have the lowest relative risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection across all time horizons. The relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 0.57 (n: 2,402, 95% CI: (0.42, 0.77), p-value: 0.003) for individuals who have taken the Polio vaccine in the past 1 year, and 0.53 (n: 2,061, (95% CI: (0.37, 0.77), p-value: 3.2e-03) for individuals who have taken the HIB vaccine in the past year. We note that these vaccines are almost exclusively administered to individuals under 18 years of age, as shown in Figure 4.  Other vaccines that are commonly administered to younger individuals with strong negative correlations with SARS-CoV-2 infection include MMR and Varicella vaccines.  The other vaccines which are consistently associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 rates include PCV13, Geriatric Flu, and HepA-HepB vaccines.  At the 1 year time horizon, the relative risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection are 0.72 for PCV13 (n: 4,693, 95% CI: (0.56, 0.92), p-value: 0.03), 0.74 for Geriatric Flu (n: 12,085, 95% CI: (0.61, 0.89), p-value: 5.6e-03), and 0.80 for HepA-HepB (n: 5,858, 95% CI: (0.67, 0.97), p-value: 0.05).  Although the relative risks are less significant compared to Polio and HIB, these associations may be particularly interesting to explore further because these vaccines are commonly administered across a broader age range of the population (see Figure 4).  Pairwise correlation analysis reveals strong associations between administration of HIB, Polio, Rotavirus, Varicella, and MMR vaccinesIn order to identify vaccines which may be confounding factors for other vaccines that are linked to reduced rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conduct a pairwise correlation analysis.  For example, it is possible that the lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infectionthat we observe for one vaccine are in fact caused by another vaccine which is highly correlated with the former. To measure the correlations we use Cohen’s kappa, which is a measure of correlation for categorical variables that ranges from -1 to +1.  Inparticular, Cohen’s kappa = +1 indicates that the pair of vaccines are always administered together, Cohen’s kappa = 0 indicates that the pair of vaccines are independent of each other, and Cohen’s kappa = -1 indicates that the pair of vaccines are never administered together.    In Figure 5, we present a heatmap of the pairwise correlations for each of the 18 vaccines administered in the 5 years prior to the PCR test date.  Sorted by Cohen’s kappa value, the top vaccine pairs with kappa ≥ 0.60 are: HIB and Rotavirus (0.83), HIB and Polio (0.80), MMR and Varicella (0.74), Polio and Varicella (0.72), Polio and Rotavirus (0.71), MMR and Polio (0.68).  From this, we see that there is a cluster of vaccines which are commonly administered together, which includes: HIB, Polio, Rotavirus, Varicella, and MMR vaccines.  The majority of individuals who receive this clusterof vaccines are children <18 years old (see Figure 4).  We note that in this cluster, the vaccines HIB, Polio, Varicella, and MMR are all consistently associated with lower SARS-CoV-2  rates.    This  suggests  that  some  of  the  lower  rates  of  SARS-CoV-2  observed  in  these vaccinated cohorts may be confounded by the other vaccines in this group.   .

4Stratification by race reveals that Polio, HIB, and PCV13 vaccines are associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 rates in particular racial subgroups across 1, 2, and 5-year time periodsIn Tables 7-9, we present the results of propensity score matching at the 1, 2, and 5-year time horizon, respectively, on study cohorts stratified by race.  We observe that PCV13 vaccination is linked with significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 rates in the Black subpopulation.  In particular, the relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for black individuals who have been administered PCV13 is 0.24 at the 1 year time horizon (n: 197, 95% CI: (0.09, 0.71), p-value: 0.03); 0.33 at the 2 year time horizon(n: 239, 95% CI: (0.16, 0.74), p-value: 0.03); and 0.45 at the 5 year time horizon (n: 653, 95% CI (0.32, 0.64), p-value: 6.9e-5).  Furthermore, at the 5-year time horizon, the relative risk for the PCV13 vaccinated cohort of black individuals is significantly lower than the relative risk for the PCV13 vaccinated cohort overall (p-value: 0.03).  In addition, we observe that Polio, HIB, and PCV13 vaccines are linked with decreased SARS-CoV-2 rates in the White subpopulation. However, since 119,979 (88%) ofindividuals in the study population are white, the relative risks for these vaccinated cohorts are close to the relative risks for the overall population (see Tables 3-5).  Matching within subgroups was done by age group (0-18, 19-49, 50-64, 65+) and blood group (A, B, AB, O) as well, but no significant within-subgroup associations  between  any  vaccine  and  SARS-CoV-2  rates  were  found.    This  suggests  that associations between vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates may not be strongly specific to particular age ranges/blood groups.Sensitivity Analysis Tipping point analysis shows that associations between reduced SARS-CoV-2 rates and Polio vaccine (1, 2 year time horizons), PCV13 (5 year time horizon) are most robust to unobserved confoundersIn this retrospective study, we evaluate the correlations between vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection, taking into account a number of possible confounding variables, such as demographic variables and geographic COVID-19 incidence rate (see Methods).  However, it is possible that the results from this study have been influenced by unobserved confounders.  For example, we do not explicitly control for travel history, which was a significant risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection early on in the pandemic.  In Figure  6,we  present  the  results  from  the  tipping  point  analysis  on  the  statistically significant associations between vaccination and reduced rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the overall study population.  For each time horizon, we show the relative prevalence and effect size that would be required for an unobserved confounder to overturn the conclusion for a given (vaccine, time horizon) pair. For reference, we show the effect size of the covariate (county-level COVID-19 incidence rate ≥ median value) as a potentialconfounder, which has a large relative risk of 2.78.At the 1 year and 2 year time horizons, the associations of the Polio vaccine to lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infectionare most robust to the impact of a potential unobserved confounder.  In particular, an unobserved confounder with a large effect size of 2.78 would need to have an absolute difference in prevalence between vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts of 17.8% (30.9%) in order to overturn the results for the 1 year (2 year) time horizon.  On the other hand, at the 5 year time  .

5horizon, the association of PCV13 and lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infectionis most robust to the influence by unobserved confounders.  An unobserved confounder with a large effect size of 2.78 would need to have an absolute difference in prevalence between vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts of 19.1% in order to render the findings insignificant. DiscussionOngoing clinical studies offer preliminary evidence that existing vaccines may reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  For example, interim results from the ACTIVATE trial12indicate that the BCG vaccine reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection rates up to 53%.  While specific vaccines such as BCG are being  tested  for  cross-protective  effects  against  SARS-CoV-2  infection  based  upon their  prior potential for protection against other diseases14, to our knowledge, a systematic hypothesis-free analysis to identify potential vaccines that can have beneficial effects against SARS-CoV-2infection is lacking. Our retrospective study has analyzed 18 different vaccines and identified key vaccines that are correlated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection after controlling for confounding factors (see Results).  In particular, we find thatindividuals who have been recently vaccinated with one of Polio, HIB, MMR, Varicella, PCV13, Geriatric Flu, or HepA-HepBvaccines have lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  These vaccines are promising candidates for follow-up pre-clinical animal studies and clinical trials. We note that this list of vaccines is preliminary and may change as more data becomes available and as further analysis is conducted.For the rest of the 18 vaccines that we considered, the correlations with SARS-CoV-2 infection were either insignificant or varied across the time horizons of interest.  In some cases, these vaccines may serve as negative controls in clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of novel COVID-19  vaccines.    For  example,  a  clinical  trial  evaluating  the  COVID-19  vaccine  candidate ChAdOx1 usesMeningococcal vaccine as a comparator arm15.  Preliminary results from this trial indicate that as expected, Meningococcal vaccine does not induce antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  It may be interesting to evaluate the antibody responses for some of the vaccines that we have found to be significantly correlated with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, to explore if there is any underlying immunologic mechanism for the associations that we observe.  Because the BCG vaccine is rarely administered in the US, this vaccine did not meet the sample size threshold for inclusion in our analysis.  From the limited data available, there were 51 individuals in the study population who had taken BCG vaccine in the past 5 years, and among these 0 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI: (0.0%, 7.0%)).  Among the 198 individuals who had taken BCG vaccine at least once in their lifetime, there were 6 (3.0%) individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI: (1.4%, 6.5%)).  As a result, more data from additional medical centers would be required for us to assess the associations between BCG vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 infection.Due to the observational nature of this study, there are potentialbiases which may have impacted the findings, including confounding, selection bias, and measurement bias.  The motivation for using propensity score matching was to account for confounding.  Although we take into accountsome  potential  confounders  through  propensity  score  matching,  there  may  still  be  residual confounding from unobserved factors (e.g. socioeconomic status, indications, contraindications, etc.) which may be different for each vaccine. For example, travel history is a risk factor for exposure  .

6to SARS-CoV-2 infection that we do not explicitly account for in this study.  Our motivation for the tipping point sensitivity analysis is to estimate the effect size and prevalence of an unobserved confounder which would be required to overturn the statistically significant findings (see Figure 6).   Evenamong the variables that we consider, there is potential for bias if the cohorts are poorly matched on those covariates.  In Tables S1-S7, we present the propensity score matching results for a number of vaccines at the 1 year time horizon, in order to show the matching quality for each of these statistical comparisons.  Furthermore, we present plots showing the distribution of the age covariate in particular in Figure S1.  We note that for some vaccines, differences in age between the vaccinated and unvaccinated (matched) cohorts may have influenced the results.  In addition, it is possible that restricting the study population to SARS-CoV-2PCR tested individuals may have introduced selection bias.  For example, vaccinated individuals may engage in more health-seeking behaviors to reduce their potential COVID-19 risk, and also have a higher likelihood of seeking out a PCR test. This type of bias is known as the “healthy user effect”, which is suspected  to  have  influenced  the  findings  of  recent  COVID-19  observational  studies16,17.    We performed sensitivity analyses using breast cancer and colon cancer screening as negative controls which suggest that the propensity score matching analysis is in part effective in filtering out healthy user  effect  for  the  associations  between  vaccination status  and  SARS-CoV-2  risk.      Finally, measurement bias is a concern as vaccination records may be incomplete for some individuals in our cohort since they may have received the vaccines outside of the Mayo Clinic system.  We plan to perform additional sensitivity analyses to further explore these potential sources of bias. As an initial exploratory analysis linking historical vaccination records to SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing results, more research is warranted in order to confirm the findings. We plan to update this analysis in coming months as more PCR testing data becomes available.  Also, we note that this study is based on data from one academic medical center in the United States, which restricts the analysis to vaccines administered in this geographic region.  Notably, we do not have sufficient immunization record data on the BCG vaccine, which has shown promise in early clinical trials.  As a result, the findings from this study would be well complemented by similar studies from hospitals across the world.  MethodsStudy designThis is an observational study in a cohort of individuals who underwent polymerase chain reaction  (PCR)  testing  for  suspected  SARS-CoV-2  infection  at  the  Mayo  Clinic  and  hospitals affiliated to the Mayo health system.  The full dataset includes 152,548 individuals who received PCR tests between February 15, 2020 and July 14, 2020.  We restricted the study population to 137,037 individuals from this dataset who have at least one ICD code recorded in the past 5 years.  This exclusion criteria is applied in order to restrict the analysis to individuals with medical history data.  Within this PCR tested cohort, we define COVIDposto be persons with at least one positive PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which includes 5,679 individuals.  Similarly, we define COVIDnegto be persons with all negative PCR test results, which includes 131,358 individuals.   .

7For the study population of 137,037 individuals, we obtain a number of clinical covariates from  the  Mayo  Clinic  electronic  health  record  (EHR)  database,  including:  demographics  (age, gender, race, ethnicity, county of residence), ICD diagnostic billing codes from the past 5 years, and immunization records from the past 5 years (68 unique vaccines; we focus on the 18 taken byat least 1,000 individuals over the past 5 years).  We use the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index to map the ICD  codes  from  each  individual from  the  past  5  years  to  a  set  of  30  medically  relevant comorbidities18.  In addition to the Mayo Clinic EHR database, we use the Corona Data Scraper online database to obtain incidence rates of COVID-19 at the county-level in the United States18,19.  By linkingthe county of residence data from the EHR with the incidence rates of COVID-19 from Corona Data Scraper, we are able to obtain county-level incidence rates of COVID-19 for 136,313 individuals in the study population.  We also obtain county-level testing data for 100,433 individuals in the study population from (i) Minnesota state government records and (ii) public county-level testing data scraped from other state/county websites.  In Table 1, we present the average values for each of the clinical covariates in the study population.  Given these clinical covariates, we conduct a series of statistical analyses to assess whether or not each of the 19 vaccines has an association with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infectionat the 1 year, 2 years, and 5 year timehorizons.  For each vaccine and time horizon, the vaccinated cohort is defined as the set of individuals in the study population who received the vaccine within the past time horizon.  For example, the “2-year polio vaccinated cohort” is the set of individuals who received the polio vaccine within the past two years.  Similarly, for each vaccine and time horizon, the unvaccinated cohort is defined as the set of individuals in the study population who did not receive the vaccine within the past time horizon.  For example, the “5-year influenza unvaccinated cohort” is the set of individuals who did not receive the influenza vaccine within the past five years.  In the following sections, we describe the statistical methods that we use to compare the rates of COVID-19 between the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts for each of the (vaccine, time horizon) pairs.  First, we describe the propensity score matching analysis to construct unvaccinated control groups that have similar clinical characteristics to the vaccinated cohorts.  Second, we describe the statistical tests that we use to determine which of the (vaccine, time horizon) pairs have the most significant association with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infectionfor the 1 year, 2 year, and 5 year time horizons, both overall and for particular demographic subgroups.  Third, we describe the covariate-level stratification analysis to identify vaccines which have the largest association with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infectionfor particular demographic subgroups. Finally, we describe the sensitivity analyses that we use to evaluate the robustness of the statistical methods to potential biases from unobserved confounders or other factors that could impact the overall results from this observational study.  Propensity score matching to construct unvaccinated control groupsBefore running the propensity score matching step, first we filtered to vaccinated cohorts with at least 1,000 persons.  For the overall statistical analysis, there were 13, 15, and 18 vaccineswhich met this threshold for the 1 year, 2 year, and 5 year time horizons, respectively.For each vaccinated cohort with sufficient numbers of individuals, we applied 1:1 propensity score matching to construct a corresponding unvaccinated control group with similar clinical  .

8characteristics20.  We refer to this as the “unvaccinated (matched)” cohort, which is a subset of the unvaccinated cohort.  We considered the following clinical covariates in the propensity score matching step:●Demographics(Age, Gender, Race, Ethnicity)●County-level COVID-19 incidence rate:(Number of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in county) / (Total population of county) within +/-1 week of PCR testing date.  ●County-level COVID-19 test positive rate:(Number of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in county) / (Number of PCR tests in county) within +/-1 week of PCR testing date.●Elixhauser comorbidities:Medical history derived from ICD diagnostic billing codes in the past 5 years relative to the PCR testing date.  Includes indicators for the following conditions: (1) congestive heart failure, (2) cardiac arrhythmias, (3) valvular disease, (4) pulmonary circulation disorders, (5) peripheral vascular disorders, (6) hypertension, (7) paralysis, (8) neurodegenerative disorders, (9) chronic pulmonary disease, (10) diabetes, (11) diabetes with complications, (12) hypothyroidism, (13) renal failure, (14) liver disease, (15) peptic ulcer disease (excluding bleeding), (16) AIDS/HIV, (17) lymphoma, (18) metastatic cancer, (19) solid tumor without metastasis, (20) rheumatoid arthritis/collagen vascular diseases, (21) coagulopathy, (22) obesity, (23) weight loss, (24) fluid and electrolyte disorders, (25) blood loss anemia, (26) deficiency anemia, (27) alcohol abuse, (28) drug abuse, (29) psychoses, (30) depression.  ●Pregnancy:Whether or not the individual had a pregnancy-related ICD code recorded in the past 90 days relative to the PCR testing date.●Number of other vaccines: Count of the totalnumber of unique vaccines (excluding the vaccine which is the treatment variable) taken by the individual inthe past 5 years relative to the PCR testing date.  For each of the vaccinated cohorts, we fit a logistic regression model to predict whether or not the individual was vaccinated, using these covariates as predictors. We trained the logistic regression model using the scikit-learnpackage in Python21.  Then, we used the model-predicted probability of an individual receiving the vaccine as the propensity score for the individual. Matching was done without replacement using greedy nearest-neighbor matching within calipers. Some  subjects  were  dropped  from  the  positive  cohort  in  this  procedure.  The matching  was performed with caliper width 0.2 * (pooled standard deviation of scores), as suggested in the literature22.Statistical assessment of associations between vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates for the overall study populationAfter the propensity score matching step, we compare the COVIDposrates for the vaccinated and unvaccinated (matched) cohorts. First, we compute the relative risk, which is equal to the COVIDposrate for the vaccinated (matched) cohort divided by the COVIDposrate for the unvaccinated (matched) cohort.  We use a Fisher exact test to compute the p-value for this association.  We then apply the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjustment23on the p-values over all vaccines for each time  .

9horizon to control the False Discovery Rate (at 0.05).  We also compute and report 95% confidence intervals for the relative risks.Statistical assessment of associations between vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates for age, race/ethnicity, and blood type stratified subgroupsWe  repeat  thestatistical  analysis  on  subsets  of  the  study  population  stratified  by  age, race/ethnicity, and blood type.  For age, we consider the subgroups: 0 to 18 years, 19 to 49 years old, 50 to 64 years old, and ≥ 65 years old. For race/ethnicity, we consider the subgroups: White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic. For blood type, we consider the subgroups: O, A, B, and AB.  We note that age and race/ethnicity were recorded in the dataset for all subjects, but blood type information was only available for 41,828 subjects.For each vaccine, at the 1, 2,and 5 year time horizons, we use propensity score matching to  construct  unvaccinated  control  groups  for  each  age  bracket,  race/ethnicity,  and  blood  type subgroup.  Matching was done on the same covariates as in the overallanalysis (apart from the Race/Ethnicity covariates for the race/ethnicity subgroups). We then compared the COVIDposrates between the vaccinated and unvaccinated (matched) cohorts, and reported the relative risk, 95% confidence interval, and BH-corrected p-values.  Sensitivity AnalysesWe performed two sets of sensitivity analyses, as described below.Cancer screens as negative controls for propensity score matching procedureTo  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  propensity  score  matching  procedure,  weran  the statistical analysis using cancer screens as the exposure variable instead of vaccinations (i.e. negative control exposure).  This set of experiments serves as a negative control because it is highly unlikely that cancer screenings are causally linked to risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.  In particular, we considered the following two cancer screens as negative controls:●Colon cancer screen: Whether or not the individual received a screening for colon cancer (within a specified time horizon relative to PCR testing date).●Mammogram: Whether or not the individual received a mammogram screening for breast cancer (within a specified time horizon relative to PCR testing date),In Table 6, we present the results from the negative control experiments.  In the unmatched cohorts, we observe that persons who have had a mammogram in the past 1, 2, or 5 years have significantly  lower  rates  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  compared  to  persons  who  have  not  had mammograms during the same time period.  For example, the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate is 2.5% among  persons  with  mammograms  in  the  past  5  years  and  4.5%  among  persons  without mammograms in the past 5 years (p-value: 1.9e-47).  This significant difference in SARS-CoV-2  .

10infection rate can be explained by confounding variables, because the unmatched cohorts have different underlying clinical characteristics.  However, after propensity score matching, the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate is 2.8% among persons with mammograms in the past 5 years and 2.8% among persons without mammograms in the past 5 years (p-value: 1).We observe similar results for the colon cancer screening covariate.  For example, the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate is 2.5% among persons with colon cancer screens in the past 5 years and 4.4% among persons without colon cancer screens in the past 5 years (p-value: 9.3e-44).  After propensity score matching, the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate is 2.5% with and 2.4% without colon cancer screens in the past 5 years (p-value: 1).  In total, 6 comparisons (2 controls, 3 time horizons each) were done.  After applying Fisher’s method to combine p-values, we get a combined p-value of 0.22 (X2= 15, df=12) against the combined hypothesis that none of the controls have an association with SARS-CoV-2 after propensity score matching.  We expect that the individuals who have recently taken cancer screens may have lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the “healthy user effect”17.  In particular, persons who have recently had  mammograms  or  colonoscopies  may  engage  in  general  health-seeking  behaviors  which decrease their risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or generally decrease their risk of a positive PCR test result.   The results from the negative control experiment demonstrates that the propensity score matching is able to correct for confounding variables which may contribute to spurious findings such as those caused by the healthy user effect.Tipping point analysisIn order to evaluate how robust the associations between vaccinations and SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study are to the effects of potential confounders, we conduct a “tipping point” analysis24.  The purpose of this analysis is to find the point at which an unobserved confounder would “tip” the conclusion on each vaccine, making the results no longer statistically significant.  Here, there are two dimensions to consider: (1) the effect size (i.e. relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection) of the confounder, and (2) the relative prevalence of the confounder in the vaccinated vs. unvaccinated (matched) cohorts.  For each vaccine, we compute the relative prevalence and effect size that would be required for an unobserved confounder to overturn the conclusion for agiven (vaccine, time horizon) pair. We present the results from the tipping point analysis in Figure 6.

The motivation for using propensity score matching was to account for confounding.  Although we take into accountsome  potential  confounders  through  propensity  score  matching,  there  may  still  be  residual confounding from unobserved factors (e.g. socioeconomic status, indications, contraindications, etc.) which may be different for each vaccine. For example, travel history is a risk factor for exposure  .

6to SARS-CoV-2 infection that we do not explicitly account for in this study.  Our motivation for the tipping point sensitivity analysis is to estimate the effect size and prevalence of an unobserved confounder which would be required to overturn the statistically significant findings (see Figure 6).   Evenamong the variables that we consider, there is potential for bias if the cohorts are poorly matched on those covariates.  In Tables S1-S7, we present the propensity score matching results for a number of vaccines at the 1 year time horizon, in order to show the matching quality for each of these statistical comparisons.  Furthermore, we present plots showing the distribution of the age covariate in particular in Figure S1.  We note that for some vaccines, differences in age between the vaccinated and unvaccinated (matched) cohorts may have influenced the results.  In addition, it is possible that restricting the study population to SARS-CoV-2PCR tested individuals may have introduced selection bias.  For example, vaccinated individuals may engage in more health-seeking behaviors to reduce their potential COVID-19 risk, and also have a higher likelihood of seeking out a PCR test. This type of bias is known as the “healthy user effect”, which is suspected  to  have  influenced  the  findings  of  recent  COVID-19  observational  studies16,17.    We performed sensitivity analyses using breast cancer and colon cancer screening as negative controls which suggest that the propensity score matching analysis is in part effective in filtering out healthy user  effect  for  the  associations  between  vaccination status  and  SARS-CoV-2  risk.      Finally, measurement bias is a concern as vaccination records may be incomplete for some individuals in our cohort since they may have received the vaccines outside of the Mayo Clinic system.  We plan to perform additional sensitivity analyses to further explore these potential sources of bias. As an initial exploratory analysis linking historical vaccination records to SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing results, more research is warranted in order to confirm the findings. We plan to update this analysis in coming months as more PCR testing data becomes available.  Also, we note that this study is based on data from one academic medical center in the United States, which restricts the analysis to vaccines administered in this geographic region.  Notably, we do not have sufficient immunization record data on the BCG vaccine, which has shown promise in early clinical trials.  As a result, the findings from this study would be well complemented by similar studies from hospitals across the world.","Multiple clinical studies are ongoing to assess whether existing vaccines may afford protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection through trained immunity. In this exploratory study, we analyze immunization records from 137,037 individuals who received SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. We find that polio, Hemophilus influenzae type-B (HIB), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella, pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13), geriatric flu, and hepatitis A / hepatitis B (HepA-HepB) vaccines administered in the past 1, 2, and 5 years are associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, even after adjusting for geographic SARS-CoV-2 incidence and testing rates, demographics, comorbidities, and number of other vaccinations. Furthermore, age, race/ethnicity, and blood group stratified analyses reveal significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 rate among black individuals who have taken the PCV13 vaccine, with relative risk of 0.45 at the 5 year time horizon (n: 653, 95% CI: (0.32, 0.64), p-value: 6.9e-05). These findings suggest that additional pre-clinical and clinical studies are warranted to assess the protective effects of existing non-COVID-19 vaccines and explore underlying immunologic mechanisms. We note that the findings in this study are preliminary and are subject to change as more data becomes available and as further analysis is conducted."
Longitudinal laboratory testing tied to PCR diagnostics in COVID-19 patients reveals temporal evolution of distinctive coagulopathy signatures,"Temporal  inference  from  laboratory  testing  results  and  their  triangulation  with clinical outcomes as described in the associated unstructured text from the providers’ notes in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is integral to advancing precision medicine. Here,  we  studied  181  COVIDposand  7,775  COVIDneg patients  subjected  to  1.3  million laboratory  tests  across  194  assays  during  a  two-month  observation  period  centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDnegat the time  of  clinical  presentation  and  diagnostic  testing,  COVIDpospatients  tended  to  have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDnegcohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop  thromboembolic  events  after  the  PCR  testing  date,  including  rare  cases  with disseminated  intravascular  coagulopathy  (DIC),  with  most  patients  lacking  the  platelet reductions  typically  observed  in  consumptive  coagulopathies.  These  temporal  trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC),  via  a  digital  framework  that  synthesizes  longitudinal  lab  measurements  with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each patient’s specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen.IntroductionThere is a growing body of evidence that severe COVID-19 outcomes may be associated with dysregulated coagulation1, including stroke, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and other  venous  or  arterial  thromboembolic  complications2.  This  so-called  COVID-19  associated coagulopathy (CAC) shares similarities with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and thrombotic microangiopathy but also has distinctive features3. Given the significance of CAC to COVID-19  mortality,  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  fine-grained  resolution  into  the  temporal manifestation  of  CAC,  particularly  in  comparison  to the  broad-spectrum  of  other,  better characterized coagulopathies. While there is a growing body of evidence suggesting associations between  COVID-19  infection  and  mortality  with  thrombocytopenia,  D-dimer  levels,  and prolongation of prothrombin time, the potentially heterogeneous signatures of CAC onset and progression as well as their connection to clinical outcomes are not well defined 1,4,5. An advanced understanding  of  this  phenotype  may  aid  in  risk  stratifying  patients,  thus  facilitating  optimal  .

2monitoring strategies during disease evolution through the paradigm of precision medicine, which hopefully will lead to further improvements in treatment decisions and overall survival. To this end, we instituted a holistic data science platform across an academic health care system that enables machine intelligence to augment the curation of phenotypes and outcomes from 15.2 million EHR clinical notes and associated 3 million lab tests from 1,192 COVID-19-positive  (COVIDpos)  and  47,344  confirmed  COVID-19-negative  (COVIDneg)  patients  over  a retrospectively  defined  2-month  observation  period  straddling  the  date  of  the  PCR  test  (see Methods). By compiling all available laboratory testing data for the 30 days preceding the SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic testing date (‘day 0’), as well as the 30 days following the diagnostic testing date, and triangulating this information with medications and clinical outcomes, we were able to identify laboratory abnormalities significantly associated with positive COVID-19 diagnosis. We identified  coagulation-related  parameters  among  this  set  of  abnormalities  and  then  studied aggregate as well as individual patient trajectories that could aid in extracting a temporal signature of CAC onset and progression. We also correlated these signals with the clinical outcomes of these patients. In order to hone into longitudinal lab test trends that would apply at the individual patient level, we restricted our analysis to patients withavailable serial testing data, which had at least 3 test results of the same type during the observation period.  After applying these inclusion criteria, 181 COVIDposand 7,775 COVIDnegpatients met study inclusion criteria. The median age in the COVIDposand COVIDneggroups were 59.9 years and 63.9 years respectively (see Methodsand Table 1), and the numbers of males were 96 (53%) and 4,064 (52%), respectively. The number of pre-existing coagulopathies in the COVIDposand COVIDneggroups were 56 (33%) and 3,325 (40%), respectively.  Overall, more patients in the COVIDnegcohort were hospitalized at the start of the study period.  In particular, the number of COVIDpospatients hospitalized on the SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing date was 23 (12.7%), compared to 1435 (18.5%) for the COVIDnegcohort. In order to balance some of these clinical covariates and others between the two cohorts, we applied 1:10 propensity score matching to define a subset of 1,810 patients from the COVIDnegcohort to use  for  the  final  statistical  analyses  (see Methods).    In  particular,  the  general  categories  of covariates  considered  for  balancing  included:  demographics,  anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication use, and hospital admission status.  Population-level characteristics of the COVIDpos,COVIDneg, and the final propensity score-matched COVIDnegcohorts are summarized in Table 1.  ResultsLongitudinal analysis highlights classes of lab abnormalities in COVID-19 progressionTo identify laboratory test results which differ between COVIDposand COVIDnegpatients, we analyzed longitudinal trends for 194 laboratory test results in the 30 days prior to and after the day of PCR testing (designated as day 0). As most patients did not undergo laboratory testing for each assay on a daily basis, we grouped the measurements into time windows reflecting potential stages of infection as follows: pre-infection (days -30 to -11), pre-PCR (days -10 to -2), time of clinical presentation (days -1 to 0), and post-PCR phases 1 (days 1 to 3), 2 (days 4-6), 3(days 7-9), 4 (days 10-12), 5 (days 13-15), and 6 (days 16-30). We only considered test-time window pairs  .

3in which there were at least three patients contributing laboratory test results in both groups. During each time window, we then compared the distribution of results from COVIDposversus COVIDnegpatients,  allowing  us  to  identify  any  lab  tests  which  were  significantly  altered  in COVIDpospatients during any time of disease acquisition, onset, and/or progression. Out  of  863  lab  test-time  window  pairswith  adequate  data  points  for  comparison,  we identified 88 such pairs (comprising 36 unique lab tests) which met our thresholds for statistical significance (Cohen’s D > 0.35, BH-adjusted Mann-Whitney p-value < 0.05) (Table 2). Among these  were  lab  tests which  may  be  considered  positive  controls  for  our  analysis,  including  a reduction in blood oxygenation in COVIDpospatients after diagnosis and elevated titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the late phase 6 (days 16-30) after diagnosis (Figures 1A-B). Wealso identified  abnormalities  in  several  other  classes  of  lab  tests,  including  immune  cell  counts (Figures 1C-G), erythrocyte-related tests (Figures 1H-I), serum chemistry (Figures 1J-K), and coagulation-related tests (Figure 2). With respect to coagulation, we found that plasma fibrinogen was significantly elevated in COVIDpospatients at the time of diagnosis (Cohen’s D = 1.092, BH-adjusted Mann-Whitney p-value = 0.016, Table 2,Figure 2A). This hyperfibrinogenemia generally resolved during the 10 days following diagnosis, even declining to levels significantly lower than the COVIDnegcohort (Figure 2A). Conversely, platelet counts were lower in the COVIDposcohort at the time of clinical presentation but tended to increase over the subsequent 10 days tolevels significantly higher than those in COVIDnegpatients (Cohen’s D = 0.361, BH-adjusted Mann-Whitney p-value = 0.008, Table 2, Figure 2B). While thrombocytopenia has been reported in COVID-19 patients before6,7, an upward trend in platelet counts after diagnosis has not been described to our knowledge. Among other coagulation-related tests, we found no difference in prothrombin time (PT) and slight elevations in activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) after diagnosis (Figure 2C). D-dimer levels were frequently above normal limits in both the COVIDposand COVIDnegcohorts and were not significantly different between these cohorts during any time windows (Figure 2D). Of note, the  observed  trends  in  both  fibrinogen  and  platelet  counts  could  not  be  attributed  to  the administration of either antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies, as drug class-matched cohorts of COVIDnegpatients failed to show these trends after the day of PCR testing (Figures 2E-F).We also performed similar analyses comparing the COVIDposand COVIDnegcohorts using different  time  windows  definitions  including  daily  trends  (Figure  3).  This  approach  offers  the advantage of increased granularity at the cost of sample size per time point, but we did identify similar lab tests as altered in COVIDpospatients using each approach including the fibrinogen decline and platelet increase in the COVIDposcohort after diagnosis (Figure 3).Thrombosis is an enriched phenotype among COVID19 patients undergoing longitudinal lab testingGiven  the  recently  described  coagulopathies  associated  with  COVID-191,2,3,  we  were intrigued by these temporal trends in fibrinogen levels and platelet counts inthe COVIDposcohort. We next asked whether the observed coagulation-related laboratory trends were associated with clinical manifestations of thrombosis. To do so, we employed a BERT-based neural network8(see Methods) to identify patients who experienced a thrombotic event after their SARS-CoV-2 testing  .

4date. Specifically, we extracted diagnostic sentiment from EHR notes (e.g. whether a patient was diagnosed with a phenotype, suspected of having a phenotype, ruled out for having a phenotype, or  other)  regarding  specific  thromboembolic  phenotypes  including  pulmonary  embolism  (PE), deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT),  venous  thromboembolism  (VTE),  thrombotic  stroke,  myocardial infarction, and cerebral venous thrombosis. We found that 40 of the total 1729 COVIDposcohort (2.3%) were positively diagnosed with one or more of these phenotypes in the 30 days after PCR testing, with the majority of these patients (27 of 40; 68%) experiencing a DVT. Interestingly, we found that after creating subsets of the patients with longitudinal lab testing data (i.e. the patients meeting the criteria for inclusion in our study), 33 of the 181 patients (18%) had at least one EHR-derived clot diagnosis, including 25 patients with DVT (Table 6). Thus, the cohort under consideration here is highly enriched (Table  4;  hypergeometric  p-value  <  1x10-20)  for  patients  experiencing  thrombotic  events compared to the overall COVIDposcohort. Longitudinal  platelet  trends  are  not  strongly  associated  with  the  development  of thrombosis in COVID-19 patientsAmong the 181 COVIDpospatients with longitudinal lab testing data, only 10 were serially tested starting at clinical presentation for fibrinogen versus 87 tested for platelets. As such, we first analyzed whether associations exist between platelet counts (or temporal alterations thereof) and clotting propensity in this cohort. Among these 87, there were 68 patients without thrombosis after  PCR-based  diagnosis  (“non-thrombotic”)  and  19  patients  with  thrombosis  (“thrombotic”). Thrombocytopenia  (platelet  count  <150x109/L)  was  observed  in  ~25%  of  COVIDpos(and COVIDneg) patients at the time of diagnosis (Figure 4A), but the platelet levels at this time point were not associated with the subsequent formation of a blood clot in the COVIDposcohort (Figure 4B). We hypothesized that the previously discussed increase in platelet counts after COVID-19 diagnosis may be associated with the development of blood clots. If true, then we would expect the thrombotic COVIDposcohort to show significantly higher maximum platelet counts during their course of disease progression compared to the non-thrombotic COVIDposcohort. We found that this was not the case, as maximum platelet counts were similar in the two groups (Figure 4C). Similarly, among the 74 COVIDpospatients with at least one post-diagnosis platelet count higher than that at the time of presentation, the degree of maximal platelet increase was not associated with the development of thrombosis (Figure 4D). It would certainly be of interest to perform this same analysis on the larger COVIDposcohort (n = 1729; 40 thrombotic vs. 1689 non-thrombotic), but we were not able to do so given the lack of longitudinal testing available for the large majority of non-thrombotic COVIDpospatients (Table 3). Conversely, we explored whether some COVIDpospatients may experience clotting in the setting of low or declining platelets (e.g., consumptive coagulopathy) despite the population-level trend of increasing platelets over time. Indeed, we found that 4 of 19 thrombotic patients showed absolute platelet counts below 100x109/L during at least one post-diagnosis time window (below dotted red line in Figure 4E). We next identified all COVIDpospatients who showed at leastone post-diagnosis platelet count lower than the count at the time of diagnosis. Interestingly, the binary presence of post-diagnosis platelet reductions was associated with thrombotic status (n = 27 of  .

568 in non-thrombotic population; n = 14 of 19 in thrombotic population; p = 0.0017). While the maximum degree of absolute platelet reduction was not associated with clot development overall (p = 0.15; Figure 4F), we did find that 3 of the 15 thrombotic patients experienced a reduction of at least 100x109/L relative to the time of diagnosis (below gray line in Figure 4F). Of note, similar fractions of non-thrombotic COVIDpospatients also showed these low or declining platelet counts, indicating that these trends are not specific indicators of thrombosis (Figures 4E-F).  Consumptive  coagulopathy  contributes  to  a  small  fraction  of  COVID-19  associated thromboses The observed declining platelet counts and thrombocytopenia in the context of thrombosis in a small fraction of COVIDpospatients is consistent with previous reports that fewer than 1% of survivors,  but  over  70%  of  non-survivors,  meet  the  International  Society  on  Thrombosis  and Hemostasis (ISTH) criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)1. As was previously noted, hyperfibrinogenemia was among the strongest lab test features distinguishing COVIDposfrom COVIDnegpatients at diagnosis, but the subsequent downward trend (Figure 2B) could be attributed to a resolving acute phase responseand/or consumption of fibrinogen in a systemic coagulopathy. Using our BERT-based sentiment extraction, we found that only 2 of the 1729 COVIDpospatients were diagnosed with DIC, all of whom were included in our longitudinal cohort of 181 COVIDpospatients. Both extracted diagnoses were manually confirmed by EHR review. This finding suggests that declining fibrinogen after COVID-19 diagnosis typically represents a physiologic return to normal range rather than pathologic coagulation factor consumption. Tofurther examine the plasma fibrinogen trends among COVID-19 patients with DIC, with non-DIC thrombosis,  and  without  thrombosis,  we  examined  patient-level  lab  test  trends  from  the  10 individuals who were tested for fibrinogen both at the time of diagnosis and at least two times subsequently. This patient-level analysis indeed revealed multiple distinct trajectories with respect to fibrinogen and other coagulation parameters in COVIDpospatients. Four of these ten individuals developed at least one blood clot during their hospital course. Only one was identified by our BERT model (and confirmed by manual EHR review) to have low-grade DIC, and as expected we found this patient’s longitudinal lab test pattern to be consistent with consumptive coagulopathy (Patient  124; Figure  5A).  At  the  time  of  diagnosis,  this  patient  showed  significant hyperfibrinogenemia  with  elevated  D-dimers  (1304.5  ng/mL)  and  a  borderline  normal  platelet count (153x109/L). Over the next ten days, this patient’s fibrinogen levels consistently decreased, reaching a minimum of 110 mg/dL on day 9. Similarly, after an initial recovery to 190x109/L the platelet counts consistently declined starting on day 2 post-diagnosis, reaching a minimum of 117x109/L on day 11. D-dimer levels exponentially increased after 5 days, reaching a maximum of 41,300 ng/mL on day 10. Phenotypically, this patient experienced both thrombotic (right internal jugular vein and right superior thyroid artery) and hemorrhagic (oropharyngeal and pulmonary) events. This combination of lab results and clinical manifestations is consistent with the diagnosis of DIC-like consumptive coagulopathy during the first week after COVID-19 diagnosis. Lab  test  results  from  the  other  three  non-DIC  thrombotic  patients  with  longitudinal fibrinogen testing confirm the presence of alternative forms of coagulopathy in the COVID-19 population. Patient 23 developed a clot on day 4 post-diagnosis in the context of a declining  .

6fibrinogen  level  and  increasing  D-dimers  but  steady  platelet  counts,  which  actually  increased shortly thereafter (Figure 5B). Patient 79 developed several clots after day 3 post-diagnosis in the setting of upward trending platelets (which eventually exceed the upper limit of normal) and elevated levels of both fibrinogen and D-dimers (Figure 5C). Patient 94 developed a clot on day 8 post-diagnosis with relatively stable platelet counts within normal limits and steadily declining fibrinogen levels (Figure 5D). Whether early elevations in plasma fibrinogen contribute to the clotting observed in the non-DIC like COVIDposcohort is unfortunately not possible for us to assess here as only one of the ten patients who received fibrinogen testing at the time of clinical presentation and twice subsequently developed thrombosis, and thispatient was diagnosed with DIC. This hypothesis may  warrant  further  analysis  in  cohorts  with  more  longitudinal  fibrinogen  data,  but  again  it  is important to note that several COVIDpospatients who presented with hyperfibrinogenemia did not go  on  to  develop  thromboses  (Figures 5E-F).  This  emphasizes  that  a  steady  post-diagnosis decline in plasma fibrinogen may represent physiologic resolution of acute phase response rather than a pathologic consumption of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors (Figures 5B, D-F). Taken  together,  this  analysis  affirms  that  a  DIC-like  coagulopathy  resulting  in  a combination of hemorrhage and thrombosis can develop in the setting of COVID-19 infection. However,  the  observations  that  (1)  DIC  was  formally  diagnosed  in  only  2  of  1729  COVIDpospatients and (2) 32 of 54 thrombotic COVIDpospatients with serial platelet testing never showed a single  platelet  count  lower  than  that  obtained  on  day  0  emphasizes  that  consumptive coagulopathy  is  an  exception  rather  than  the  rule  as  it  pertains  tothrombotic  phenotypes  in COVID-19 patients. DiscussionA number of studies on clinical characteristics and lab tests are shedding light on the spectrum of hematological parameters associated with COVID-19 patients. In an initial study of 41  patients  from  Wuhan,  the  blood  counts  in  COVIDpospatients  showed  leukopenia  and lymphopenia, and prothrombin time and D-dimer levels were higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients9. Another study based on 343 Wuhan COVIDpospatients found that a D-dimer level of at least 2.0 μg/ml could predict mortality with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%10. An independent study of 43 COVID-19 patients found significant differences between mild and severe cases in plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), D-dimers, glucose, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and C-reactive  protein  (P <0 .05)4.  While  such  studies  indeed  highlight  that  hematological  and inflammatory abnormalities are prevalent in COVIDpos, a high-resolution temporal understanding of how these parameters evolve in COVID-19 patients post diagnosis has not been established. Specifically, in the wake of accumulating evidence for hypercoagulability in COVIDpospatients, there  are  important  clinical  questions  emerging  regarding  the  necessity  of  and  guidelines  for thromboprophylaxis in patient management. The ability to derive this longitudinal understanding of COVID-19 progression, including laboratory abnormalities and their associated clinical manifestations, mandates the synthesis of structured and unstructured EHR data (e.g., lab tests and clinical notes) at a large scale. The fact that  tens  of  thousands  of  patients  have  undergone  SARS-CoV-2  testing  at  major  academic  .

7medical centers (AMCs) provides an abundance of potential data to perform this analysis but also poses significant challenges from a practicality standpoint. Manual review and curation of patient trajectories and associated testing results is not practical, nor is it likely to provide comprehensive or  even  entirely  accurate  individual  patient  records.  Rather,  triangulation  across  datasets, including lab measurements, clinical notes, and prescription information, using a scalable digitized approach  to  extract  structured  data  along  with  sentiment-surrounded  clinical  phenotypes  and outcomes is required to efficiently perform this analysis in a timely fashion. By developing and deploying such a digitized platform on the entirety of EHR data from a large AMC, we have identified in an unbiased manner, laboratory abnormalities that characterize COVIDpospatients from their COVIDnegcounterparts who also presented with symptoms leading to the performance of a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The abnormalities in coagulation-related tests, including  fibrinogen  and  platelets,  were  intriguing  in  the  context  of  literature  reporting  the occurrence of various clotting phenotypes in COVID-19 patients, including DIC-like consumptive coagulopathies along with more isolated clotting events in the lungs, central nervous system, and other tissues1,2,3. Our finding that consumptive coagulopathy represents a minority of COVID-19 associated  clotting  events  corroborates  and  provides  context  for  other  studies  which  have reported overt DIC or DIC-like disease in over 70% ofnon-survivors but far lower fractions of survivors1. A study of 83 COVID-19 patients suggests that when LMWH prophylaxis was initiated on hospital admission, progression to DIC was rare11.While our analysis highlights that consumptive coagulopathy should be considered in the minority of COVIDpospatients with significant serial reductions in platelet counts, it remains to be seen  whether  the  post-diagnosis  platelet  increases  or  early  hyperfibrinogenemia  which  we observed may contribute mechanistically to the clotting in the much larger non-DIC thrombotic COVID-19 population. It is important to note that despite the trend of increasing platelets, the platelet count only extended above the normal range (>450x109/L) in 24 of 135 COVIDpospatients with serial measurements, and the development of such outright thrombocytosis was observed with  similar  frequencies  in  the  thrombotic  and  non-thrombotic  cohorts.  Further,  the  fact  that several  patients  with  elevated  fibrinogen  (i.e.  >400  mg/dL)  at  presentation  did  not  develop thromboses suggests that early hyperfibrinogenemia is not a singular driver of subsequent clotting events, but a small sample size (n = 10 patients; 9 non-thrombotic vs. 1 thrombotic) limited the power of this analysis. Despite these uncertainties, this linking of longitudinal trends to patient outcomes provides several  useful  pieces  of  clinical  information,  including  but  not  limited  to:(1)  Early hyperfibrinogenemia is to be expected in COVID-19 patients and may not be useful in determining an appropriate thromboprophylaxis approach for a given patient. (2) Declining fibrinogen levels shortly after diagnosis are also expected and likely represent the resolution of an acute phase response  in  most  patients  rather  than  a  decline  secondary  to  the  onset  of  consumptive coagulation. (3) Borderline or overt thrombocytopenia is common in COVID-19 patients at the time of clinical presentation, and the initial platelet count does not robustly predict patients who are  likely  to  develop  thromboses.  (4)  After  diagnosis,  COVID-19  patients  generally  show  an upward  trend  in  platelets.

8There  certainly  remains  much  to  understand  regarding  the  molecular  pathophysiology underlying COVID-19 associated thrombosis. While elevations in fibrinogen and D-dimer have been reported (and confirmed by our analyses), the circulating levels of tissue factor and other coagulation factors have not been assessed broadly in this population. Interestingly, single cell RNA-sequencing data highlights that the respiratory tract, including the nasal cavity, are strongly enriched for high expression of tissue factor (encoded by the gene F3) (Figure 6A). Specifically, F3is highly expressed in epithelial cells of these tissues -the same cell types which have been found to express ACE2, the putative entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Figures 6B-C). Type II pneumocytes, which may also express ACE2and have been reported as a putative entry site for SARS-CoV-212–14,  are  also  strongly  enriched  among  all  human  cell  types  showing  high F3expression (Figure 6A). Whether infection-related damage to these epithelial cells may lead to shedding of tissue factor into circulation or its increased exposure circulating coagulation factors locally in respiratory tissues would be interesting to evaluate. Such a mechanism could at least partially  contribute  to  the  development  of  clots  systemically  and  locally  in  the  pulmonary vasculature. This has been confirmed in at least 3 autopsy series that reported both microthrombi and pulmonary emboli in a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients15.In  addition  to  our  findings  regarding  abnormal  coagulation  parameters  in  COVID-19 patients, we identified several other laboratory features which differed from the COVIDnegcohort. For example, others have previously reported leukopenia and T cell deficiencies in COVID-19 patients at presentation 9,16; we identified a leukopenia which existed both prior to and at the time ofclinical presentation which recovered during the week following COVID-19 diagnosis (Figure 1C). Specifically, we found that monocytes, basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils followed this temporal trend (Figures 1D-G). With respect to erythrocytes, we found that both COVIDposand COVIDnegpatients developed a worsening mild anemia after PCR testing, but the trajectory was actually slower for COVIDpospatients (Figures 1B, 1H, Table 1). This progressive anemia was interestingly paralleled by a declining mean corpuscular volume unique to the COVIDposcohort (Figure 1I). This may represent an inflammation associated anemia and could simply be related to repeated blood testing (i.e., mild blood loss) in these patients. Among serum chemistry tests, we observed distinct patterns showing reduced calcium in COVIDpospatients at presentation and through the first week of infection versus elevated magnesium between days 4 and 15 (Figures 1J-K). While low calcium at the time of presentation has been previously described in COVID-19 patients 17, elevations in serum magnesium levels in the 1-2 weeks after diagnosis have not been reported. Determining whether these serum chemistry alterations are induced by SARS-CoV-2or have any impact on viral replication or pathogenicity, although preliminary analyses have shown no  association  between  these  lab  measurements  at  any  time  point  and  patient  mortality  (not shown). It is important to note that while we center the study period around the PCR testing date, this date may not correspond to the same disease state of COVID-19 for each individual in the COVIDposcohort. Additionally, there are several covariates which may influence these longitudinal trends  and  should  be  explored  further.  For  example,  we  have  already  considered  whether previous or concomitant administration of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents influences patient lab test results and/or outcomes. In Figure 2D-E, we present the longitudinal platelet counts and fibrinogen levels for subsets of the COVIDposand COVIDnegcohort who are on and off these  .

9medications. While we do observe elevated levels of platelets generally in the COVIDnegcohort who are on antiplatelets, this potential medication effect does not alone account for the differences in platelet levels that we observe in the COVIDposcohort. Similarly, the authors wish to explore whether  longitudinal  lab  measurement  trends  differ  between  outpatient,  inpatient,  and  ICU admitted patient cohorts. New data sets can also be utilized; for example, rather than grouping patients by the identified thromboembolic phenotypes extracted from the clinical notes alone, patients could be stratified by those who had imaging studies (Duplex ultrasound, CT scan, etc.) performed, and phenotypes could be directly extracted from these procedural reports. As more data accumulates from COVIDposand COVIDnegpatients in the coming months, these analyses will be expanded to assess similarities and differences in the temporal trendsof laboratory test results among a wider range of patient subgroups relevant for COVID-19 outcomes, such as those who have pre-existing conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, obesity, malignancies) or patients who are on specific medication (e.g., ACE inhibitors, statins, immunosuppressants). In summary, this work demonstrates significant progress in our goal of enabling scaled and  digitized  analyses  of  longitudinal  unstructured  and  structured  EHR  records  to  identify variables (e.g., laboratory results) which are associated with relevant clinical phenotypes (e.g., COVID-19 diagnosis and outcomes). In doing so, we identified trends in lab test results which may be relevant to monitor in COVID-19 patients and warrant both clinical and mechanistic follow-up in more targeted and explicitly controlled prospective analyses. ","A number of studies on clinical characteristics and lab tests are shedding light on the spectrum of hematological parameters associated with COVID-19 patients. In an initial study of 41  patients  from  Wuhan,  the  blood  counts  in  COVIDpospatients  showed  leukopenia  and lymphopenia, and prothrombin time and D-dimer levels were higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients9. Another study based on 343 Wuhan COVIDpospatients found that a D-dimer level of at least 2.0 μg/ml could predict mortality with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%10. An independent study of 43 COVID-19 patients found significant differences between mild and severe cases in plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), D-dimers, glucose, thrombin time, fibrinogen, and C-reactive  protein  (P <0 .05)4.  While  such  studies  indeed  highlight  that  hematological  and inflammatory abnormalities are prevalent in COVIDpos, a high-resolution temporal understanding of how these parameters evolve in COVID-19 patients post diagnosis has not been established. Specifically, in the wake of accumulating evidence for hypercoagulability in COVIDpospatients, there  are  important  clinical  questions  emerging  regarding  the  necessity  of  and  guidelines  for thromboprophylaxis in patient management. The ability to derive this longitudinal understanding of COVID-19 progression, including laboratory abnormalities and their associated clinical manifestations, mandates the synthesis of structured and unstructured EHR data (e.g., lab tests and clinical notes) at a large scale.

7medical centers (AMCs) provides an abundance of potential data to perform this analysis but also poses significant challenges from a practicality standpoint. Manual review and curation of patient trajectories and associated testing results is not practical, nor is it likely to provide comprehensive or  even  entirely  accurate  individual  patient  records.  Rather,  triangulation  across  datasets, including lab measurements, clinical notes, and prescription information, using a scalable digitized approach  to  extract  structured  data  along  with  sentiment-surrounded  clinical  phenotypes  and outcomes is required to efficiently perform this analysis in a timely fashion. By developing and deploying such a digitized platform on the entirety of EHR data from a large AMC, we have identified in an unbiased manner, laboratory abnormalities that characterize COVIDpospatients from their COVIDnegcounterparts who also presented with symptoms leading to the performance of a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The abnormalities in coagulation-related tests, including  fibrinogen  and  platelets,  were  intriguing  in  the  context  of  literature  reporting  the occurrence of various clotting phenotypes in COVID-19 patients, including DIC-like consumptive coagulopathies along with more isolated clotting events in the lungs, central nervous system, and other tissues1,2,3. Our finding that consumptive coagulopathy represents a minority of COVID-19 associated  clotting  events  corroborates  and  provides  context  for  other  studies  which  have reported overt DIC or DIC-like disease in over 70% ofnon-survivors but far lower fractions of survivors1. A study of 83 COVID-19 patients suggests that when LMWH prophylaxis was initiated on hospital admission, progression to DIC was rare11.While our analysis highlights that consumptive coagulopathy should be considered in the minority of COVIDpospatients with significant serial reductions in platelet counts, it remains to be seen  whether  the  post-diagnosis  platelet  increases  or  early  hyperfibrinogenemia  which  we observed may contribute mechanistically to the clotting in the much larger non-DIC thrombotic COVID-19 population. It is important to note that despite the trend of increasing platelets, the platelet count only extended above the normal range (>450x109/L) in 24 of 135 COVIDpospatients with serial measurements, and the development of such outright thrombocytosis was observed with  similar  frequencies  in  the  thrombotic  and  non-thrombotic  cohorts.  Further,  the  fact  that several  patients  with  elevated  fibrinogen  (i.e.  >400  mg/dL)  at  presentation  did  not  develop thromboses suggests that early hyperfibrinogenemia is not a singular driver of subsequent clotting events, but a small sample size (n = 10 patients; 9 non-thrombotic vs. 1 thrombotic) limited the power of this analysis. Despite these uncertainties, this linking of longitudinal trends to patient outcomes provides several  useful  pieces  of  clinical  information,  including  but  not  limited  to:(1)  Early hyperfibrinogenemia is to be expected in COVID-19 patients and may not be useful in determining an appropriate thromboprophylaxis approach for a given patient. (2) Declining fibrinogen levels shortly after diagnosis are also expected and likely represent the resolution of an acute phase response  in  most  patients  rather  than  a  decline  secondary  to  the  onset  of  consumptive coagulation. (3) Borderline or overt thrombocytopenia is common in COVID-19 patients at the time of clinical presentation, and the initial platelet count does not robustly predict patients who are  likely  to  develop  thromboses.  (4)  After  diagnosis,  COVID-19  patients  generally  show  an upward  trend  in  platelets.  Patients  whose  platelets  trend  down  after  diagnosis  should  be monitored,as platelet reductions after clinical presentation are associated with thromboses and significant reductions may be indicative of ongoing consumptive coagulopathy.  .

Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each patient’s specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen."
LENZILUMAB EFFICACY AND SAFETY IN NEWLY HOSPITALIZED COVID-19 SUBJECTS: RESULTS FROM THE LIVE-AIR PHASE 3 RANDOMIZED DOUBLE-BLIND PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL,"BACKGROUND:  Severe  COVID-19  pneumonia  results  from  a  hyperinflammatory  immune  response  (cytokine  storm,  CS),  characterized  by  GM-CSF  mediated  activation  and  trafficking  of  myeloid  cells,  leading  to  elevation  of  downstream  inflammatory  chemokines (MCP-1, IL-8, IP-10), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1), and other markers of systemic inflammation  (CRP,  D-dimer,  ferritin).  CS  leads  to  fever,  hypotension,  coagulopathy,  respiratory  failure,  ARDS,  and  death.  Lenzilumab  is  a  novel  Humaneered®  anti-human  GM-CSF  monoclonal  antibody  that  directly  binds  GM-CSF  and  prevents  signaling  through   its   receptor.   The   LIVE-AIR   Phase   3   randomized,   double-blind,   placebo-controlled  trial  investigated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  lenzilumab  to  assess  the  potential  for lenzilumab to improve the likelihood of ventilator-free survival (referred to herein as survival  without  ventilation,  SWOV),  beyond  standard  supportive  care,  in  hospitalized  subjects  with  severe  COVID-19.  METHODS:  Subjects  with  COVID-19  (n=520),  >18 years,  and  ≤94%  oxygen  saturation  on  room  air  and/or  requiring  supplemental  oxygen,  but not invasive mechanical ventilation, were randomized to receive lenzilumab (600 mg, n=261)  or  placebo  (n=259)  via  three  intravenous  infusions  administered  8  hours  apart.  Subjects  were  followed  through  Day  28  following  treatment.  RESULTS:  Baseline  demographics  were  comparable  between  the  two  treatment  groups:  male,  64.7%;  mean  age, 60.5 years; mean BMI, 32.5 kg/m2; mean CRP, 98.36 mg/L; CRP was <150 mg/L in 77.9%  of  subjects.  The  most  common  comorbidities  were  obesity  (55.1%),  diabetes  (53.4%), chronic kidney disease (14.0%), and coronary artery disease (13.6%).  Subjects received  steroids  (93.7%),  remdesivir  (72.4%),  or  both  (69.1%).  Lenzilumab  improved   .

4the likelihood of SWOV by 54% in the mITT population (HR: 1.54; 95%CI: 1.02-2.31, p=0.041)  and  by  90%  in  the  ITT  population  (HR:  1.90;  1.02-3.52,  nominal  p=0.043)  compared to placebo. SWOV also relatively improved by 92% in subjects who received both corticosteroids and remdesivir (1.92; 1.20-3.07, nominal p=0.0067); by 2.96-fold in subjects  with  CRP<150  mg/L  and  age  <85  years  (2.96;  1.63–5.37,  nominal  p=0.0003);  and  by  88%  in  subjects  hospitalized  ≤2  days  prior  to  randomization  (1.88;  1.13-3.12,  nominal p=0.015). Survival was improved by 2.17-fold in subjects with CRP<150 mg/L and  age  <85  years  (2.17;  1.04-4.54,  nominal  p=0.040).  CONCLUSION:  Lenzilumab  significantly   improved   SWOV   in   hospitalized,   hypoxic   subjects   with   COVID-19   pneumonia  over  and  above  treatment  with  remdesivir  and/or  corticosteroids.  Subjects  with  CRP<150  mg/L  and  age  <85  years  demonstrated  an  improvement  in  survival  and  had the greatest benefit from lenzilumab. NCT04351152  .

5INTRODUCTION The   clinical   manifestations   of   coronavirus   disease   2019   (COVID-19)   range   from   asymptomatic  disease  to  critical  illness,  acute  respiratory  disease  (ARDS),  and  death.    These pathologies result from the viral-induced hyperinflammatory immune response, or cytokine storm (CS).  CS in COVID-19 is similar to that resulting from chimeric antigen receptor    T-cell    therapy    (CAR-T),    hemophagocytic    lymphohistiocytosis    (HLH),    macrophage  activation  syndrome  (MAS),  and  acute  graft-versus-host  disease  (GvHD)1; where  CS  intensity  is  directly  correlated  with  the  severity  of  tissue  injury,  neurological  manifestations,  and  adverse  clinical  outcomes.2-6    CS  is  characterized  by  granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor  (GM-CSF)-mediated  activation  and  trafficking  of  myeloid  cells7,  leading  to  elevations  of  downstream  inflammatory  chemokines  (MCP-1,  IL-8,  IP-10),  cytokines  (IL-6,  IL-1),  and  other  markers  of  systemic  inflammation  (CRP,  D-dimer, ferritin). In  COVID-19,    high  levels  of  GM-CSF-secreting  T-cells  have  been  associated  with  disease  severity,  myeloid  cell  trafficking  to  the  lungs,  and  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)  admission.8-10         Elevation   of   circulating   GM-CSF   in   subjects   with   emerging   hyperinflammation  four  days  after  symptom  onset  differentiated  mild/moderate  from  severe   disease.10      Since   GM-CSF   is   produced   by   activated   T-cells   in   tissue   microenvironments  and  is  bound  by  extracellular  matrix  and  receptors,  its  detection    in  the   serum   indicates   significantly   elevated   tissue   levels   that   orchestrate   local   and   subsequently, systemic hyperinflammatory activity.    .

6CRP  levels  greater  than  100  mg/L  upon  hospital  admission  are  one  of  the  strongest  predictors  of  critical  illness,  even  more  so  than  age  greater  than  75  years  or  other  comorbid conditions associated with COVID-19.11,12 Subjects with CRP above 150 mg/L are defined as experiencing COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation (COV-HI) and are at  risk  of  escalated  respiratory  support  or  death.13CRP  is  a  readily  available  and  cost-effective  biomarker  that  can  be  used  to  delineate  the  state  of  COV-HI,  help  to  identify  subjects  with  emerging  CS,  and  predict  the  need  for  early  intervention  to  prevent  or  reduce progression to IMV and intensive care.14,15Lenzilumab  is  a  novel  Humaneered®  anti-human  GM-CSF  monoclonal  antibody  that  directly binds GM-CSF and prevents signaling through its receptor.   It has high binding affinity (25 pM) for glycosylated human GM-CSF and a slow off-rate.16 Lenzilumab has more than 94% specificity to the human germline to minimize immunogenicity, is highly soluble  at  a  pH  of  7.0  to  minimize  potential  for  infusion  reactions,  and  in  an  extensive  pre-clinical  toxicology  program  demonstrates  a  No  Observed  Adverse  Effect  Level  (NOAEL)  of  >100  mg/kg/week  (data  on  file).    No  treatment  emergent  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  or  Suspected  Unexpected  Serious  Adverse  Reactions  (SUSARSs)  have  been  reported  across  any  of  the  four  completed  clinical  development  studies  (data  on  file).      Lenzilumab   can   be   dosed   in   a   regimen   designed   to   achieve   therapeutic   concentrations to neutralize GM-CSF in both serum and lung tissue.

Herein are reported the efficacy safety results following 28 days of follow-up.   METHODS Trial Design The LIVE-AIR trial (NCT04351152) was a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled  study  in  520  hospitalized  subjects  with  severe  COVID-19  pneumonia  across  29  sites  in  the  U.S.  and  Brazil.    The  study  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  Good  Clinical  Practice  guidelines  of  the  International  Council  for  Harmonization  E6  and  the  principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.  The protocol was approved by the central/local institutional review board or ethics committee at each site.   All  subjects  provided  written  informed  consent.  Enrolled  participants  were  randomized  1:1  to  receive  lenzilumab  or  matched  placebo  in  addition  to  current  standard  treatment  per institutional guidelines at each site.

Subjects  were  excluded  if  they  required  IMV  or  extracorporeal  membrane  oxygenation  (ECMO), were pregnant or, in the view of the treating investigator, were not expected to survive the following forty-eight hours from the time of randomization.   Subjects with a confirmed  diagnosis  of  bacterial  pneumonia  or  other  active/uncontrolled  fungal  or  viral  infection other than SARS-CoV-2 were also excluded.  Women of childbearing potential were  eligible  if  they  had  a  negative  urine  or  serum  pregnancy  test  at  screening/baseline  and agreed to adequate contraception following their last dose of study drug. Treatments Lenzilumab  or  matching  placebo  (0.9%  saline  for  injection)  was  administered  by  intravenous  infusion  beginning  at  Day  0  within  12  hours  of  randomization.  Three  doses  of lenzilumab (600 mg, each) or placebo were administered 8 hours apart via a 1 hour IV infusion,  in  addition  to  standard  supportive  care.    Standard  pre-infusion  medications  comprised of acetaminophen 500 to 1000 mg PO or IV and diphenhydramine 12.5 to 25 mg IV, or 25 mg PO or equivalent, and were administered approximately 1-hour prior to infusion of study drug. Allowed treatments, at baseline and throughout the study, included all current COVID-19 treatments:  corticosteroids,  convalescent  plasma,  remdesivir  or  other  anti-virals,  and/or  hydroxychloroquine  with  or  without  azithromycin.

Sargramostim  as  well  as  other  investigational  therapies  to  treat  COVID-19  were  not  permitted. Outcomes Measures Assessment  of  COVID-19  associated  pneumonia  for  development  of  adult  respiratory  distress syndrome (ARDS) was conducted during the hospital stay through day 28.  This included  symptom-directed  physical  examination,  assessment  of  clinical  status  using  an  8-point ordinal scale adapted (1 = death, 8 = no hospitalization, no limitations) from the NIH-sponsored  Adaptive  COVID-19  Treatment  Trial  (ACTT,  NCT  04280705)19,  vital  signs,  laboratory  tests,  use  of  IMV  or  ECMO,  non-invasive  ventilation  (or  high-flow  oxygen devices), and low-flow supplemental oxygen, ICU admission, assessment of key cytokines, and adverse events. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite endpoint of ventilator-free  survival  also  referred  herein  as  survival  without  ventilation  (SWOV),  by  Day  28.    Failure  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  defined  as  mortality  or  the  requirement  for  IMV.    SWOV  is  a  robust composite endpoint that is less prone to favor treatments with discordant effects on survival  and  days  free  of  ventilation20  while  avoiding  the  need  for  sample  sizes  approaching  those  of  mortality  trials  to  enable  timely  availability  of  study  results.    Key  secondary  endpoints  included  the  proportion  of  IMV,  ECMO  or  death,  mortality,  and  Time to Recovery based on the 8 point clinical status scale.   .

17improvement in likelihood of SWOV was over and above treatment with remdesivir and corticosteroids.      Additionally,   improvement   in   SWOV   was   observed   in   subjects   hospitalized  for  less  than  2  days.    Finally,  improvement  in  SWOV  was  most  evident  in  patients  with  CRP<150  mg/L  who  are  less  than  85  years  of  age.    Lenzilumab  was  associated with similar improvements on key secondary endpoints including; incidence of IMV,  ECMO  or  death,  mortality,  and  time  to  recovery  in  those  subjects  with  CRP<150  mg/L  and  <  85  years.  Treatment  with  lenzilumab  was  safe  and  well  tolerated  with  a  serious adverse event profile no different from placebo.  Safe  and  effective  therapeutics  to  treat  hospitalized  subjects  with  COVID-19  remains  a  significant  unmet  clinical  need.    The  NIH  currently  recommends  against  the  use  of  dexamethasone  in  hospitalized,  hypoxic  subjects  who  do  not  require  supplemental  oxygen and data regarding the benefit of remdesivir in this population are conflicting and insufficient  to  recommend  for  use.25  Recommendations  supporting  the  combination  of  dexamethasone and remdesivir in hospitalized subjects on low-flow supplemental oxygen are based primarily on expert opinion according to the NIH as no randomized controlled studies have evaluated these agents in combination.25  The primary population where the use  of  dexamethasone  has  proven  to  significantly  improve  mortality  is  in  subjects  on  IMV  who  are  <70  years  of  age.    Data  reported  on  the  use  of  tocilizumab  is  conflicting;  and  baricitinib  is  reserved  for  those  with  contraindications  to  corticosteroid.    In  LIVE-AIR,  early  intervention  with  lenzilumab  improved  the  relative  likelihood  of  SWOV  through  Day  28  by  54%  in  hospitalized,  racially  and  ethnically  diverse  subjects  with   .

18COVID-19, who had several comorbid conditions and were hypoxic but did not require mechanical ventilation at baseline. CRP  was  analyzed  as  it  is  a  marker  of  systemic  inflammation,  routinely  used  clinically  and known to be proportionally elevated with the severity of COVID-19 disease.11-13    In  this  trial,  77%  of  subjects  with  an  evaluable  CRP,  had  a  baseline  value  <150  mg/L  and  74%  had  a  baseline  CRP  value  <150  mg/L  and  age<85.    The  CRP  analysis  clearly  demonstrated  that  CRP  less  than  150  mg/L  was  associated  with  best  likelihood  of  achieving SWOV and clearly differentiated emerging hyperinflammation from full-blown CS.    In  subjects  with  CRP<150  mg/L  and  <  85  years  old,  lenzilumab  improved  SWOV  by nearly 3-fold and was accompanied by a 2.17-fold improvement in mortality as well as  a  36%  improvement  in  time  to  recovery.    Given  that  CRP  is  a  readily  available,  routinely measured biomarker of systemic inflammation, with prognostic value affirmed in  this  and  other  trials11,12,    it  can  clearly  be  used  to  clinically  identify  a  phenotype  of  COVID-19 disease that best responds to lenzilumab treatment. LIVE-AIR used a composite primary endpoint of SWOV which includes time to death or time  to  invasive  mechanical  ventilation.    This  endpoint  has  been  called  “ventilator-free  survival” and “alive and ventilator-free”.  The nomenclature selected in LIVE-AIR more accurately   captures   the   meaning   of   the   endpoint   without   confusion   by   alternate   interpretations.  Regardless of nomenclature, the composite endpoint is appropriate for an event-based  clinical  trial  of  this  size  to  predict  a  clinically  meaningful  outcome  that  equates  ventilation  with  mortality.20    It  is  not  confounded  by  mechanisms  that  may   .

19preferentially affect either ventilation or death.20  Lenzilumab’s ability to improve SWOV was more pronounced in combination with current treatments including remdesivir which has  demonstrated  a  5  day  improvement  in  time  to  recovery23  and  dexamethasone  which  improved  survival  in  subjects  needing  respiratory  support21,26  which  may  indicate  a  synergistic mechanism of action with the triple combination. This robust improvement in the composite endpoint demonstrates the potential for lenzilumab treatment to result in a true  improvement  in  survival  since  nearly  all  subjects  that  die  from  COVID-19  have  received IMV during their hospital stay.  Confirmation of the lenzilumab improvement of survival,  and  the  role  of  SWOV  as  a  surrogate  endpoint,  could  be  confirmed  in  a  large  adequately powered mortality trial.   The  results  with  lenzilumab  on  SWOV  demonstrate  that  impeding  GM-CSF  signaling  early in CS is required to prevent COVID-19 disease progression to IMV or death.  This is further supported by an 88% improvement in SWOV in subjects hospitalized < 2 days.  The results herein with lenzilumab confirm results from prior clinical trials targeting GM-CSF  but  are  differentiated  by  patient  selection,  timing  of  intervention,  and  dosing  strategy.    Mavrilimumab,  a  monoclonal  antibody  that  acts  as  a  GM-CSF  alpha-receptor  antagonist demonstrated non-significant trends of 48% improvement in survival without requirement  for  supplemental  oxygen.27    Otilimab,  a  monoclonal  antibody  targeting  circulating   GM-CSF   in   ventilated   subjects,   was   reported   in   a   non-peer-reviewed   disclosure of results from its phase 2b COVID-19 study (NCT04376684) to not meet its primary  endpoint  of  improvement  in  the  proportion  of  COVID-19  subjects  who  were  alive and free of respiratory failure 28 days; however, in pre-planned analysis of subjects  .

20aged at least 70 years, which comprised 22% of the entire patient population, 65.1% were alive  and  free  of  respiratory  failure,  compared  to  45.9%  of  subjects  who  received  the  standard  of  care.28    The  results  of  all  three  trials  of  GM-CSF  antagonism  suggest  the  central role of GM-CSF in CS of COVID-19 that has been recently demonstrated through network   analysis   of   cytokine   profiles   from   COVID-19   subjects.10      This   analysis   associated    IL-6,  CXCL10,  but  in  particular  GM-CSF,  to  markers  of  endothelial  injury  and  thrombosis  early  in  COVID-19,  in  severe  cases,  in  hospitalized  subjects  and  those  with  risk  factors  for  severe  disease,  and  uniquely  elevated  in  fatal  COVID-19.    The  results  herein  with  lenzilumab  more  completely  define  the  central  role  of  GM-CSF  in  COVID-19,  identified  subjects  more  likely  to  receive  benefit  from  lenzilumab  and  underscores    the    necessity    to    target    GM-CSF    early    during    the    emerging    hyperinflammatory stage in order to ameliorate CS induced by COVID-19. The  findings  of  the  network  analysis  and  the  anti-GM-CSF  approaches  listed  above,  including the robust response to lenzilumab particularly in subjects with CRP levels <150 mg/L  and  age<85,  helps  explain  the  limited  efficacy  of  other  anti-cytokine  approaches  that target cytokines downstream of myeloid cell activation in the CS cascade (i.e., IL-6, TNFα,  IL-10).  Results  from  clinical  trials  with  anti-IL-6  agents  are  mixed  and  mostly  negative.22,29-33.  Targeting single downstream mediators of CS, such as IL-6, may render therapy clinically ineffective as other key, redundant cytokines continue to promote tissue damage   or   are   even   compensatory   upregulated   in   the   absence   of   IL-6   signaling.         Alternatively, it is possible that targeting IL-6 is more effective later in the disease course  .

21as  evidenced  by  tocilizumab  wherein  benefit  appears  to  be  derived  in  more  critically  ill  subjects recently admitted to the ICU.22In  the  LIVE-AIR  study,  lenzilumab  was  studied  as  a  real-world  early  intervention  in  hospitalized,    hypoxic    subjects    not    requiring    invasive    mechanical    ventilation;    hypothesizing  that  neutralizing  GM-CSF  during  emerging  hyperinflammation,  could  prevent  the  consequences  of  full-blown  CS,  in  subjects  at  risk  but  already  treated  with  standard  of  care.  Lenzilumab  improved  the  robust  endpoint  of  SWOV,  the  effect  of  which was more pronounced in emerging hyperinflammation than in subjects who were further evolved in their disease course.  LIVE-AIR has two important limitations.  First, while  it  demonstrated  an  improvement  in  survival  in  subjects  with  CRP<150  mg/L  and  aged  <85,  the  study  was  not  powered  to  observe  a  survival  benefit,  and  indeed  did  not  achieve  statistical  significance  on  this  key  secondary  endpoint  in  the  mITT  population.    Second, the observations pertaining to benefits in the population that had CRP<150 mg/L and age <85 were exploratory. Despite high vaccine efficacy and uptake in some countries, hospitalizations for COVID-19  will  continue  to  occur  given  the  propensity  for  mutation  and  escape  from  protection  that  occurs  through  natural  immunological  selection.34    A  proportion  of  those  subjects  will unfortunately progress to hypoxia and hospitalization.  For them, dexamethasone is currently  the  only  treatment  approach  shown  to  provide  a  survival  benefit.    This  study  demonstrates  that  early  neutralization  of  GM-CSF  with  lenzilumab,  a  key  initiator  and  orchestrator  of  CS,  in  newly  hospitalized  hypoxic  subjects  can  improve  their  likelihood   .

22of  survival  without  the  need  for  mechanical  ventilation  and  defines  a  targeted  patient  population most likely to derive the greatest benefit over and above that of steroids and/or remdesivir.","BACKGROUND Severe COVID-19 pneumonia results from a hyperinflammatory immune response (cytokine storm, CS), characterized by GM-CSF mediated activation and trafficking of myeloid cells, leading to elevation of downstream inflammatory chemokines (MCP-1, IL-8, IP-10), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1), and other markers of systemic inflammation (CRP, D-dimer, ferritin). CS leads to fever, hypotension, coagulopathy, respiratory failure, ARDS, and death. Lenzilumab is a novel Humaneered® anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody that directly binds GM-CSF and prevents signaling through its receptor. The LIVE-AIR Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of lenzilumab to assess the potential for lenzilumab to improve the likelihood of ventilator-free survival (referred to herein as survival without ventilation, SWOV), beyond standard supportive care, in hospitalized subjects with severe COVID-19.

METHODS Subjects with COVID-19 (n=520), ≥18 years, and ≤94% oxygen saturation on room air and/or requiring supplemental oxygen, but not invasive mechanical ventilation, were randomized to receive lenzilumab (600 mg, n=261) or placebo (n=259) via three intravenous infusions administered 8 hours apart. Subjects were followed through Day 28 following treatment.

RESULTS Baseline demographics were comparable between the two treatment groups: male, 64.7%; mean age, 60.5 years; mean BMI, 32.5 kg/m2; mean CRP, 98.36 mg/L; CRP was <150 mg/L in 77.9% of subjects. The most common comorbidities were obesity (55.1%), diabetes (53.4%), chronic kidney disease (14.0%), and coronary artery disease (13.6%). Subjects received steroids (93.7%), remdesivir (72.4%), or both (69.1%). Lenzilumab improved the likelihood of SWOV by 54% in the mITT population (HR: 1.54; 95%CI: 1.02-2.31, p=0.041) and by 90% in the ITT population (HR: 1.90; 1.02-3.52, nominal p=0.043) compared to placebo. SWOV also relatively improved by 92% in subjects who received both corticosteroids and remdesivir (1.92; 1.20-3.07, nominal p=0.0067); by 2.96-fold in subjects with CRP<150 mg/L and age <85 years (2.96; 1.63–5.37, nominal p=0.0003); and by 88% in subjects hospitalized ≤2 days prior to randomization (1.88; 1.13-3.12, nominal p=0.015). Survival was improved by 2.17-fold in subjects with CRP<150 mg/L and age <85 years (2.17; 1.04-4.54, nominal p=0.040).

CONCLUSION Lenzilumab significantly improved SWOV in hospitalized, hypoxic subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia over and above treatment with remdesivir and/or corticosteroids. Subjects with CRP<150 mg/L and age <85 years demonstrated an improvement in survival and had the greatest benefit from lenzilumab. NCT04351152"
First Clinical Use of Lenzilumab to Neutralize GM-CSF in Patients with Severe and Critical COVID-19 Pneumonia,"Background: In  COVID-19,  high  levels  of  granulocyte  macrophage-colony  stimulating  factor (GM-CSF)  and  inflammatory  myeloid  cells  correlate  with  disease  severity,  cytokine  storm,  and respiratory failure. With this rationale, we used lenzilumab, an anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, to treat patients with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia.  Methods: Hospitalized  patients with COVID-19 pneumonia  and risk  factors for poor outcomes were treated with lenzilumab 600 mg intravenously for three doses through an emergency single-use IND application. Patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory outcomes, and adverse events were  recorded.  All  patients  receiving  lenzilumab  through  May  1,  2020  were  included  in  this report.  Results: Twelve  patients  were  treated  with  lenzilumab.  Clinical  improvement  was  observed  in 11  out  of  12  (92%),  with  a  median  time  to  discharge  of  5  days.  There  was  a  significant improvement  in  oxygenation:  The  proportion  of  patients  with  SpO2/FiO2  <  315  at  the  end  of observation was 8% vs. compared to 67% at baseline (p=0.00015). A significant improvement in mean  CRP  and  IL-6  values  on  day  3  following  lenzilumab  administration  was  also  observed (137.3  mg/L  vs  51.2  mg/L,  p  =  0.040;  26.8  pg/mL  vs  16.1  pg/mL,  p  =  0.035;  respectively). Cytokine  analysis showed  a  reduction in inflammatory  myeloid  cells two  days after lenzilumab treatment.  There  were  no  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  attributable  to  lenzilumab,  and  no mortality in this cohort of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia.  Conclusions: In  high-risk  COVID-19  patients  with  severe  and  critical  pneumonia, GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab was safe and associated with improved clinical outcomes, oxygen requirement, and cytokine storm.

INTRODUCTION  The clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2  (SARS-CoV-2) infection, range from asymptomatic disease to severe and  critical pneumonia. 1,2  Although  viral  evasion  of  host  immune  response  and  virus-induced  cytopathic effects are believed to be critical for disease progression, most deaths associated with COVID-19 are  attributed  to  the  development  of cytokine  release  syndrome  (CRS)  and resultantacute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 3CRS  is  characterized  by  an elevation  of  inflammatory  cytokines  resulting  in  fever, hypotension, capillary leak syndrome, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, respiratory failure, and ARDS.4,5 The development of CRS as a direct result of immune hyper-stimulation has been previously described in patients with autoimmune andlymphoproliferative diseases,6 as well as in patients with B-cell malignancies receiving chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy.7,8Over the last five years, preclinical studies and correlative science from clinical   trials   in   CART   therapy   have   shed   light onthe   pathophysiology,   development, characterization, and management of CRS. 5,9CRS during CART therapy is characterized by activation of myeloid cells and release ofinflammatory    cytokines,    including interleukin-6    (IL-6), granulocyte-monocyte    colony stimulating  factor  (GM-CSF),  monocyte  chemoattractant  protein -1  (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory  protein  1α(MIP-1α), Interferon   gamma-induced   protein   10 (IP-10),   and interleukin-1  (IL-1). 4,7,10The  cascade,  once initiated,  can  quickly  evolve  into  a  cytokine  storm,resulting  in  further activation, expansion  and  trafficking  of  myeloid  cells,  leading  to  abnormal endothelial    activation,    increased    vascular    permeability, and disseminated   intravascular coagulation. 11,12All rights reserved.

Similar  to  patients  receiving  CART  therapy,  the  development  of  CRS in  patients  with COVID-19 has been  associated with  elevation of CRP, ferritin, and  IL-6, as well as correlatingwith  respiratory  failure,  ARDS,  and  adverse  clinical  outcomes.13-17Most  significantly,  high levels of GM-CSF-secreting  Th17  T-cells  have  been  associated  with  disease  severity,  myeloid cell  trafficking  to  the  lungs,  and  ICU  admission.18  This  indicates  that post-COVID-19 CRS is caused  by  a  similar  mechanism, induced  by  activation  of  myeloid  cells  and  their  trafficking  to the  lung,  resulting  in  lung  injury  and  ARDS.18  Tissue  CD14+  myeloid cells produce  GM-CSFand   IL-6,   further   triggering   a   cytokine   storm   cascade.18   Single-cell   RNA   sequencing   of bronchoalveolar  lavage  samples  from  COVID-19  patients  with  severe  ARDS  demonstrated an overwhelming  infiltration  of  newly-arrived  inflammatory  myeloid  cells  compared  to  mild COVID-19  disease  and  healthy  controls,  consistent  with  a  hyperinflammatory CRS-mediated pathology.19With  this  understanding  of  the pathophysiology  of  COVID-19,  modalities  to  target inflammatory cytokines and suppress or prevent CRS after COVID-19 have been investigated in pilot  clinical  trials.  IL-6  blockade  has shown  encouraging  results.20  Controlled  clinical  trials using  IL-6  blockade,  as  well  as  other  immunomodulatory  molecules  targeting  receptor  tyrosine kinase are ongoing. GM-CSF depletion has  been  developed as  a  strategy  to  mitigate  CRS followingCART therapy.  We  have  shown  that  GM-CSF neutralization results  in  a  reduction  in  IL-6,  MCP-1, MIP-1α, IP-10, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) levels,  demonstrating  that  GM-CSF  is  an upstream  regulator  of  many  inflammatory  cytokines that are important in the pathophysiology of CRS.21  GM-CSF depletion results in modulation of myeloid  cell  behavior, a  specific  decrease  in  their  inflammatory  cytokines, and  a  reduction  in All rights reserved.

tissue  trafficking, 21  while  enhancing  T-cell  apoptosis  machinery.22These  biological  effects prevented  both  CRS  and  neuro-inflammation  after  CART  therapy  in  preclinical  models  and arebeing tested in a phase Ib/II clinical trial (NCT 04314843).  Lenzilumab  is  a  first-in-class  Humaneered®  recombinant  monoclonal  antibody  targeting human  GM-CSF,  with  potential  immunomodulatory  activity,  high  binding  affinity  in  the picomolar  range,  94%  homology  to  human  germline,  and  has  low  immunogenicity.  Following intravenous  administration,  lenzilumab  binds  to  and  neutralizes  GM-CSF,  preventing  GM-CSF binding  to its  receptor,  thereby  preventing  GM-CSF-mediated  signaling  to  myeloid  progenitor cells.23 Lenzilumab has been studied across 4 completed clinical trials in healthy volunteers, and persons with asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.24,25 A total of 113  individuals  received  lenzilumab  in  these  trials;  lenzilumab  was  very  well  tolerated  with a low frequency and severity of adverse events.24,25Given the hypothesized role of GM-CSF in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 related CRS, along  with  our  studies  demonstrating  that  GM-CSF  depletion  prevents  CRS  and  modulates myeloid  cell  behavior  in  preclinical  models,21  lenzilumab  therapy  was  offered  to  patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, who had clinical and/or biomarker evidence for increased risk of progression to respiratory failure.  METHODS   Patients Hospitalized  patients  with  COVID-19,  confirmed  by  reverse  transcriptase-polymerase  chain reaction for the SARS-CoV-2, and radiographic findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia were  considered  for  treatment  with  lenzilumab  through  an  emergency  IND  program.      Active systemic infection with bacteria, fungi, or other viruses, was  an exclusion criterion. All patients All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

received lenzilumab 600 mg administered via a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 8 hours for a total  of  three  doses  (1800  mg).  A  request  for  lenzilumab  under  FDA  emergency  use  IND  was submitted  to  the  FDA  in  accordance  with  agency  guidelines  (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-investigational-drug-or-biologic).  Informed consent and Institutional review board approval was obtained for each patient. Study assessments There  were  no  pre-specified  study  endpoints  or  mandated  procedures.  All  laboratory  tests  and radiologic  assessments  were  performed  at  the  discretion  of  the  treating  physician  and  per standard clinical management processes. Vital signs were monitored before and upon completion of each lenzilumab infusion. Demographics, co-existing conditions, laboratory and radiographic data,  as  well  as  clinical  data,  adverse  events,  and  outcomes  were  captured  from  the  electronic health record until data cutoff on May 1, 2020. Data were for all patients for a minimum of five days  following  the  administration  of  lenzilumab.  Baseline  values  were  defined  as  those  values obtained prior to lenzilumab administration, either on the day of administration or the day before the  administration.  Cytokine  analysis  was  performed  on  available  serum  isolated  from  patients, pre and post lenzilumab treatment. Serum was diluted 1:2 with assay buffer before following the manufacturer’s  protocol  for  Milliplex  Human  Cytokine/Chemokine  MAGNETIC  BEAD Premixed 38 Plex Kit (Millipore Sigma, Ontario, Canada). Data were collected using a Luminex (Millipore Sigma, Ontario, Canada). Statistical Methods Continuous variables at baseline are represented using the median and interquartile range (IQR).

ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); 3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation  or  high  flow  oxygen  devices;  4)  Hospitalized,  requiring  supplemental  oxygen;  5) Hospitalized,  not  requiring  supplemental  oxygen  -  requiring  ongoing  medical  care  (COVID-19 related  or  otherwise);  6)  Hospitalized,  not  requiring  supplemental  oxygen  -  no  longer  requires ongoing  medical  care;  7)  Not  hospitalized,  limitation  on  activities;  8)  Not  hospitalized,  no limitations  on  activities  (as  recommended  by  the  WHO  R&D  Blueprint  Group).26  Statistical significance for differences in temperature, serum CRP concentration, serum IL-6 concentration, absolute lymphocyte counts  (ALC), and platelet  counts  on day -1 versus day  3 post-lenzilumab was  determined  using  a  two-tailed  paired  t-test.  Day  3  was  determined  as  the  last  value  for statistical analysis as data post day 3 were not available for more than 50% of this cohort. RESULTS   Patients and baseline characteristics Twelve  patients  received  full  treatment  with  3  doses  of  lenzilumab  administered  8  hours  apart. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table 1.  Eight  patients  (67%)  were  male;  the  median  age  was  65.0  years  (range  29-81).  Median  BMI was  29  (range  22-42).  Nine  patients  were  white,  2  were  Asian,  and  1  American  Indian/Native American. All patients had at least one comorbidity associated with poor outcomes. Seven (58%) had diabetes mellitus, 7 (58%) had hypertension, 6 (50%) had obesity (BMI > 30), 2 (17%) had chronic   kidney   disease,   2   (17%)   had   coronary   artery   disease   and   1   (8%)   was   on immunosuppressive   therapy   with   a   history   of   kidney   transplantation.   Seven (58%)   had underlying lung disease: 4 (33%) with obstructive sleep apnea, 2 (17%) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 1 (8%) with reactive airway disease.   All rights reserved.

All patients required oxygen supplementation at baseline; 1 patient was on non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, 8 (67%) were on low flow oxygen, 3 (25%) were on high flow oxygen.  The median  SpO2/FiO2  ratio  was  281,  with  SpO2/FiO2  ratios  below  315  in  8  (67%)  patients,  and below  235  in  3  (25%)  patients.  Additionally,  6  (50%)  patients  were  febrile  within  24-48  hours prior to lenzilumab administration, with a median temperature of 38.3 °C. Seven (58%) patients had lymphopenia at baseline, with an absolute lymphocyte count less than 0.95  x  109/L.  All  patients  had  an  elevation  in  at  least  one  inflammatory  marker  at  baseline. Eleven  (92%)  patients  had  elevated  CRP  values  above  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (>8.0  mg/L), with  a  median  of  103.2  mg/L.  Ten  (83%)  patients  had  elevated  ferritin  values  above  the  upper limit  of  normal  (>336  mcg/L),  with  a  median  of  596  mcg/L.  All  11  patients  with  IL-6  levels available  at  baseline  had  elevated  values  above  the  upper  limit  of  normal  (>1.8  pg/mL),  with  a median  of  30.95  pg/mL.  Of  the  11  patients  with  D-dimer  levels  available  at  baseline,  9  (75%) had values above the upper limit of normal (>500 ng/mL), with a median of 829 ng/mL.  Clinical Outcomes Clinical improvement, as defined by the improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical  endpoints  scale,  was  observed  in  11  out  of  12  (92%)  patients  (Figure 1A), with a ≥ 3-point  improvement  in  10  patients  and  a  2-point  improvement  in  1  patient  (Figure  1A).  The median  time  to  a  2-point  clinical  improvement  was  5  days  (95%  CI,  2-7  days).  All  11  patients with  clinical  improvement  were  discharged  after  a  median  of  5  days  (range  3  -19)  post- lenzilumab.    The  patient  discharged  on  day  19  was  ready  for  discharge  on  day  9  but  remained hospitalized for social reasons.There was a significant improvement in mean temperature at day 3 compared to baseline (37.95vs.  36.97,  p=0.023,  Figure  1B).

48 hours of lenzilumab administration. There was a significant improvement in the proportion of patients  with  SpO2/FiO2  <  315  at  the  end  of  observation  compared  to  baseline  (8%  vs.  67%,p=0.00015 SpO2/FiO2 level baseline vs. last value, Figure 1C). Of 8 patients with SpO2/FiO2 < 315  at  baseline,  SpO2/FiO2  improved  to  >  315  in  four  on  day  1  post-lenzilumab.  Five  (42%) patients were discharged on home oxygen, including one patient who had been on home oxygen pre-COVID-19 illness. One patient (8.3%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. There were no deaths. Figure 1D depicts individual patient hospitalization and oxygen requirement status.  Laboratory markers  Compared  to  baseline,  there  was  significant  improvement  in  mean  CRP  and  IL-6  on  day  3 following lenzilumab administration (137.3 mg/L vs. 51.2 mg/L, p = 0.040; 26.8 pg/mL vs. 16.1 pg/mL,  p  =  0.035;  respectively)  (Figures  2A,  B).  Compared  to  baseline,  an  improvement  of  at least 50% was observed in CRP levels in 6 patients (50%) by day 2, and IL-6 levels in 4 patients (33.3%) by day 3. There was a significant increase in mean platelet count from baseline to day 3 post  lenzilumab  (217.7  x109/L  vs  261.8  x109/L,  p  =  0.001,  Figure  2C).  There  was  also  a  trend toward  improved  absolute  lymphocyte  counts  on  day  3  compared  to  baseline  (0.89  x  109/L  vs 1.14 x 109/L, p = 0.107, Figure 2C). Analysis of human cytokines comparing pretreatment with 48  hours  post-lenzilumab  treatment  in  one  patient  revealed  significant  reduction  in  multiple cytokines involved in the cytokine storm (G-CSF, MDC, GM-CSF, IL-1α, IFN-γ, IL-7, FLT-3L, IL-1rα, IL-6, IL-12p70, Figure 2E). Safety of Lenzilumab Treatment There  was  no  significant  difference  in  mean  absolute  neutrophil  count  or  hemoglobin  values between  baseline  and  day  3  post  lenzilumab:  5.1x109/L  vs.  4.8  x109/L,  p=0.27;  12.9  g/dL  vs.11.4  g/dL,  p=0.89;  respectively.

day 0 to 7.9 g/dL on day 6. This patient had undergone a renal biopsy on day 2; imaging revealed a subcapsular hematoma. At the last study observation, the patient remained anemic at 9.3 g/dL. There were no infusion reactions with lenzilumab administration. One patient, with a history of restless  leg  syndrome,  reported  a  “pins  and  needles”  sensation  during  the  first  dose  of lenzilumab; those symptoms resolved and did not recur with subsequent infusions of lenzilumab. No other treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab were noted.  DISCUSSION There  is  no  therapy  with  proven  efficacy  against  COVID-19  at  present.  We  report  our observations  from  the  first-ever  use  of  lenzilumab  to  neutralize  GM-CSF  in  the  treatment  of COVID-19.  Lenzilumab  was  offered  through  a  compassionate  single-use  IND  to  patients  with severe  and  critical  COVID-19  pneumonia.  Based  on  the  pathophysiology  of  cytokine  storm following  SARS-CoV-2  infection1,27,  along  with  our  preclinical  work21,  we  hypothesized  that lenzilumab-induced  GM-CSF  depletion  prevents  CRS  in  COVID-19  and  progression  to  severe disease  or  death.  At  baseline,  all  12  patients  had  at  least  one  risk  factor  associated  with  poor outcomes:  age,  smoking  history,  cardiovascular  disease,  diabetes,  chronic  kidney  disease, chronic lung disease, high BMI, and elevated inflammatory markers, with several patients having multiple  such  risk  factors.28,29  In  this  cohort  of  high-risk  patients  with  severe  and  critical COVID-19 pneumonia, treatment with lenzilumab was associated with improved overall clinical outcome  in  11/12  patients  (91.7%)  on  an  8-point  ordinal  scale;  all  11  patients  were  discharged after  a  median  of  5  days.    Significant  improvement  in  oxygen  requirement,  as  well  as inflammatory  cytokines  and  markers  of  disease  severity,  were  also  observed.  These  results  are consistent  with  our  original  hypothesis,  and  corroborate  our  laboratory  findings  following  GM-CSF  depletion  in  preclinical  models  of  CRS  after  CART  cell  therapy.21  In  addition,  the  use  of All rights reserved.

lenzilumab  was  associated  with  a  significant  improvement  in  platelet  count,  indicating  possibly an overall improved coagulopathy associated with CRS post-COVID-19.30 Interestingly, the use of  lenzilumab  in  this  cohort  was  associated  with  a  trend  to  an  increase  in  lymphocyte  count (Figure 2D). We have recently shown that GM-CSF depletion results in modulation of apoptosis pathways in T cells.22 It is unclear at this time if the increase in lymphocyte count is secondary to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or  a direct effect of GM-CSF on T cells; this question will be answered  in  the  planned  phase  III  trial.  Figure  3  depicts  a  proposed  mechanism  for  the  role  of GM-CSF in CRS post-COVID-19.   Five  patients  received  other  pharmacotherapies  targeting  COVID-19  besides  lenzilumab.  Three patients  received  hydroxychloroquine;  one  patient  received  remdesivir  and  one  patient  received steroids.  Two  patients  received  lenzilumab  after  the  failure  of  clinical  improvement  with  either hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir and subsequently improved. Two patients received lenzilumab concomitantly  with  hydroxychloroquine;  both  of  these  patients  were  discharged  home.  One  of these patients also received off-label tocilizumab on day 6 post-lenzilumab and was released on home oxygen.  One patient received steroid therapy concomitantly with lenzilumab; this patient remained on invasive mechanical ventilation on the last day of observation. The  use  of  lenzilumab  was  safe,  without  any  adverse  events  attributable  to  lenzilumab.  While there  is  a  theoretical  concern  for  bone  marrow  toxicity  when  GM-CSF  is  depleted,  lenzilumab treatment  was  not  associated  with  any  hematological  toxicity  in  this  cohort.  There  were  no infusion  reactions  following  lenzilumab  treatment.  Importantly,  a  sensation  of  pins  and  needles reported by one patient while receiving lenzilumab, did not recur with subsequent infusions; the patient had a history of restless leg syndrome. Restless legs have not been described in any of the non-COVID-19 patients who have received lenzilumab for other indications.   All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Our  report  has  several  limitations.  First,  the  sample  size  is  small  and  did  not  include  controls. Second, as lenzilumab was offered under emergency single-use IND conditions, all management decisions,  including  prescribing  medications  and  laboratory/radiologic  monitoring,  were  at  the discretion of the treating clinicians. This resulted in some heterogeneity in the treatment specifics of  individual  patients  as  well  as  the  laboratory  and  other  diagnostic  data  that  were  collected. Given this and the absence of a control arm in the study, we cannot, with full confidence, declare that the clinical improvement that we noted in our patients was clearly and solely attributable to lenzilumab.  These  limitations  will  be  addressed  in  the  recently  initiated  randomized  Phase  III clinical trial (NCT04314843).   In  summary,  we  administered  lenzilumab,  under a  single-use  emergency  IND  compassionate program, to 12 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia and with risk factors for disease  progression.  Lenzilumab  use  was  associated  with  improved  clinical  outcomes,  oxygen requirement,   and   cytokine   storm   in   this   cohort   of   patients,   with   no   reported   mortality. Lenzilumab was well tolerated; no treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab were observed. ","Background In COVID-19, high levels of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and inflammatory myeloid cells correlate with disease severity, cytokine storm, and respiratory failure. With this rationale, we used lenzilumab, an anti-human GM-CSF monoclonal antibody, to treat patients with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and risk factors for poor outcomes were treated with lenzilumab 600 mg intravenously for three doses through an emergency single-use IND application. Patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory outcomes, and adverse events were recorded. All patients receiving lenzilumab through May 1, 2020 were included in this report.

Results Twelve patients were treated with lenzilumab. Clinical improvement was observed in 11 out of 12 (92%), with a median time to discharge of 5 days. There was a significant improvement in oxygenation: The proportion of patients with SpO2/FiO2 < 315 at the end of observation was 8% vs. compared to 67% at baseline (p=0.00015). A significant improvement in mean CRP and IL-6 values on day 3 following lenzilumab administration was also observed (137.3 mg/L vs 51.2 mg/L, p = 0.040; 26.8 pg/mL vs 16.1 pg/mL, p = 0.035; respectively). Cytokine analysis showed a reduction in inflammatory myeloid cells two days after lenzilumab treatment. There were no treatment-emergent adverse events attributable to lenzilumab, and no mortality in this cohort of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia.

Conclusions In high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe and critical pneumonia, GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab was safe and associated with improved clinical outcomes, oxygen requirement, and cytokine storm."
